Feb 18 (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O and JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O said on Thursday they are launching the first phase of their partnership with codeshares on nearly 80 routes from New York and Boston.
The joint announcement came even as the U.S. Department of Justice and attorneys general in New York, Massachusetts and other jurisdictions continue to review the proposed tie-up.
""American and JetBlue intend to cooperate with those investigations, but are proceeding with plans to implement this alliance,"" American said in its annual report released late Wednesday.
New York-based low-cost carrier JetBlue and international major American are hoping the partnership, announced in July, will give them more competitive heft in the U.S. Northeast as the industry recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, which has decimated travel.
""The alliance is also essential to getting our planes back in the air profitably and crewmembers working again,"" said JetBlue's head of revenue planning, Scott Laurence.
The two airlines are also introducing 33 new routes in the first phase of their alliance, which American's chief revenue officer, Vasu Raja, called ""the first step to delivering the best customer proposition with the biggest network in New York and Boston.""
Codesharing allows travelers to book with one airline for flights operated by a partner. The two airlines will also begin offering reciprocal benefits on their loyalty programs this spring.
Following a U.S. Department of Transportation review, American and JetBlue agreed to divest some slots at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) near Washington and will refrain from coordinating on some markets.
JetBlue pilots voted earlier this week to reject a tentative agreement that would have given the airline contractual relief to implement the partnership. JetBlue said it still planned to move forward.
The union representing American Airlines' pilots said on Thursday it was still analyzing the codesharing announcement.

4461.0,2021-05-19 00:00:00 UTC,3 Consumer Cyclical Stocks to Buy for the Coming Travel Explosion,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-consumer-cyclical-stocks-to-buy-for-the-coming-travel-explosion-2021-05-19,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
For nearly a year, when it came to the novel coronavirus, there have been multiple divisions in America. Now that the nation looks poised to be (mostly) on one page regarding the coronavirus, many cyclical stocks, especially those in the travel sector, look positioned to get a big lift.
Until very recently, there were important divisions among states and consumers. And in the travel sector, there was a sharp contrast between business travel and leisure travel.
In general, the economies and schools of so-called red states were opened, while many schools and businesses in blue states remained fully or partially closed. Most consumers who had received vaccines were no longer afraid of going back to their pre-pandemic lives, but some were still fearful. And while leisure travel had bounced back dramatically, business travel remained depressed.
7 High Quality Industrial Stocks to Buy Now
I believe that the May 14 announcement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as President Joe Biden saying that vaccinated people no longer have to wear masks, will largely end those divisions. To most Americans, the announcement will show that those who have received vaccinations no longer have to worry much about the virus.
Lior Rennert, assistant professor of biostatistics in the Department of Public Health Science at Clemson University, wrote in an email to InvestorPlace that, “Fortunately, we are at a point now in the United States where we will soon have a surplus of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. … Furthermore, all vaccines have proved to be highly effective against severe infection. Therefore, we should not expect many lockdowns this year.”
“Starting this summer, the EU will allow fully vaccinated American tourists to visit,” he further wrote. “However, it is not yet clear which countries will still have strict lockdown measures. The good news is that all vaccines have proven to be highly effective in preventing severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, we should expect to see an increase in travel among those vaccinated in the coming months.”
Indeed, since Biden and his administration are seen as extremely cautious about the coronavirus and are trusted by most of those who were afraid of the illness, the proclamation will act as an “all-clear” sign regarding the virus. Further, most of the adults who haven’t received a shot probably are not scared of the coronavirus.
Consequently, schools and businesses are going to open across the country. Fear of travel will decline. With most of their employees no longer afraid of traveling, companies will be able to send their sales teams and executives on trips again.
All of this, of course, is great news for cyclical stocks in general and travel stocks in particular. Three of the best consumer cyclical plays on the (very welcome!) “end of the end” of the pandemic in the U.S. are:
Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H)
Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE)
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)
Cyclical Stocks: Hyatt Hotels (H)

Encouragingly, on Hyatt’s first-quarter results conference call, CEO Mark Hoplamazian said, “The pent-up demand for travel is immense. And with the number of fully vaccinated potential travelers growing by the millions each day, we feel we’re at the beginning of a growing level of demand for our hotels.”
Further, the hotel operator’s revenue per available room (Rev PAR) increased 54% in March versus January, compared with the usual seasonal gain of about 25%. Powered by strong spring break demand in the U.S. and relaxed travel restrictions in China, leisure travel led the way. And in the second “half of March,… leisure transient room nights for comparable hotels surpassed levels during the same period in 2019,” Hoplamazian said.
Hyatt’s focus on high-end consumers is positive because white-collar workers tended to have been largely unaffected financially by the pandemic. Moreover, upper-income consumers are less likely to be hurt by inflation than people with lower incomes.
Finally, Hyatt should get much more of a boost from the return of business travel than lower-end hotel chains.
Expedia (EXPE)

The company’s Q1 results showed that its business already began rebounding meaningfully last quarter. as its sales jumped to $1.25 billion versus $920 million in Q4. What’s more, Expedia’s Q1 bookings dropped just 14% from the previous year, and its top- and bottom-line results came in well above analysts’ average outlook.
Speaking on the company’s Q1 earnings conference call, CEO Peter Kern said that “the summer looks strong,” setting up EXPE stock to continue performing well over the next few months. He added that “the (booking) trends are very good, and we’re excited about that.”
In recent weeks, a number of analysts have been very bullish on Expedia. On May 3, for example, Wells Fargo named the shares as one of its “signature picks” in the consumer discretionary category. UBS on April 26 identified Expedia as a company whose “strong pricing power” should enable it to outperform other stocks even as inflation rises.
Given its high market share and strong brand, Expedia is positioned to benefit tremendously from pent-up demand in the travel sector.
Cyclical Stocks: American Airlines (AAL)
AAL) airplane waiting on the tarmac. Represents airline stocks."" width=""300"" height=""169"">

On April 22, American Airlines reported that it expects its Q2 capacity to drop 20% to 25% from 2019 levels, amid “signs of continued recovery in demand.” The airline expects to end Q2 with a robust $19.5 billion of liquidity.
And supporting my thesis on business travel returning, American says it is seeing early signs of a rebound in that category, saying that “small business demand, which was roughly 17% of our system revenue, has been improving steadily as vaccination rates have increased and as markets reopened.”
With small business travel accounting for 17% of AAL stock’s revenue, the company is positioned to benefit from a much bigger comeback of business travel.
On April 23, Raymond James raised AAL stock to “market perform” from “underperform,” citing improved profitability and a better risk-reward ratio.
Unlike some of its peers, AAL stock remains well below its 52-week high and its 2019 levels, indicating that it has a great deal of room to rally.

Gains in U.S. stock index futures were limited by negative carryover from a slide in European stocks as the 10-year German bund yield jumped to a 3-week high after Reuters reported that the ECB's new economic estimates due to be released Thursday will show a Eurozone inflation forecast for 2024 above 3%, bolstering the case for the ECB to raise interest rates at Thursday’s policy meeting.

Across the markets…
December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ23) on Wednesday closed up +4.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -4.1 bp to 4.239%.  Dec T-note prices Wednesday recovered from a 3-week low and moved higher, and the 10-year T-note yield fell back from a 3-week high of 4.342%.  T-notes found support Wednesday after U.S. Aug core CPI eased to +4.3% y/y from +4.7% y/y in July, right on expectations and the slowest pace of increase in almost two years.  T-notes also moved higher on strong demand for the Treasury’s $20 billion auction of re-opened 30-year T-bonds with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.46, better than the 10-auction average of 2.39.
T-notes Wednesday initially fell on negative carryover from a slump in 10-year German bunds to a 3-week low.  Also, the stronger-than-expected U.S. Aug CPI was bearish for T-notes.  In addition, inflation expectations rose early Wednesday and weighed on T-notes after the 10-year breakeven inflation rate posted a 4-week high of 2.371% before falling back.

Oct 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes fell on Wednesday after a strong showing of private jobs in September fueled bets that the Federal Reserve could start reining in its monetary stimulus soon, while worries lingered about the government debt ceiling.
A gridlock in Congress about the debt limit showed no sign of abating, as Senate Democrats planned a third attempt to get Republicans to vote to raise the federal government's borrowing authority and head off a catastrophic default.
""There's definitely no question that there's unease and uncertainty that is finally weighing on investor sentiment and performance,"" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.
""Between the policy issues - the debt ceiling and the status of two large spending bills - to see the stocks sell off after such an extended run is not all that surprising.""
Mega-cap growth companies pared some declines, with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O edging higher after the benchmark U.S. 10-year yield US10YT=RR retreated from three-month highs by early afternoon trading. US/

The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 568,000 jobs last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a rise of 428,000 jobs.
""Positive labor market data comes with the implication that the Fed can tighten policy at a quicker pace. But the fact that hiring is up shouldn't be discounted — it's definitely a good thing in terms of recovery,"" said Mike Loewengart, managing director, investment strategy at E*TRADE Financial.
The numbers come ahead of the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data on Friday, which is expected to cement the case for the Federal Reserve's slowing of asset purchases.
Oil prices hit multi-year highs earlier in the day, stoking concerns that major central banks will tighten monetary policy to counter sharp price rises. However, crude prices retreated from those highs, while the S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY slid 1.5%.
Up to Tuesday's close, the S&P 500 index .SPX logged its fourth straight day of 1% moves in either direction. The last time the index saw that much volatility was in November 2020, when it rose or fell 1% or more for seven straight sessions.

4230.0,2021-09-03 00:00:00 UTC,3 Ways You Can Beat Warren Buffett in the Stock Market,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-ways-you-can-beat-warren-buffett-in-the-stock-market-2021-09-03,,,"He's called the Oracle of Omaha for good reason. Warren Buffett -- all-around investing genius and founder of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) as we know it -- has the stock-picking track record to support that unofficial title. While his conglomerate may have gotten off to a slow start coming out of 2020's pandemic-induced market plunge, its share price is up nearly 24% year to date, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has risen by just under 21%. That's a big difference when you're comparing a buy-and-hold portfolio to an index-based benchmark. Plenty of investors would be thrilled with that sort of edge. Beating the market is tough to do!
And yet, it's not crazy to believe you can not only beat the market, but perhaps even beat Buffett at his own game. The trick lies in successfully doing what Berkshire Hathaway is mostly unable to do, and doing what Buffett doesn't particularly like to do. Here's a look at the three biggest things you can do differently than Buffett in your investing strategy.
1. Invest in the types of growth stocks he typically doesn't consider
Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio has certainly evolved from its early, value-oriented days. For instance, its biggest single stock holding right now is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- a company that Buffett might not have even dreamed of investing in a couple of decades ago (though Buffett may not have made the Apple buy call on his own). Software company Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) is another relatively curious addition to Berkshire's collection of stocks, in that it's quite unprofitable and will remain so for a while.
Nevertheless, most of Berkshire's positions are in established value companies like Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Verizon (NYSE: VZ), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Buffett likes them because, first, he understands their business models, and second, they pay reliable dividends. It also doesn't hurt that steady-performing value stocks have historically managed to catch up with and even surpass the hot-and-cold track records of gains that growth stocks tend to dish out.
It's just possible, however, the market has outgrown its resilient-but-lukewarm love for value stocks. Since the mid-1990s, growth stocks have rather reliably outperformed value names despite their higher volatility. Overall, as a group, they've gained nearly three times as much as value stocks have over that timeframe.
^IVX data by YCharts
That's not to suggest there's anything inherently wrong with investing in value stocks. But refusing to be at least a bit speculative leaves the sort of gains that have been dished out by growth companies like Facebook and Nvidia on the table.
2. Step into an entire position on a dip
As a small retail investor, you enjoy one advantage that giant players like Berkshire Hathaway don't have: When you put a few thousand bucks into a trade, the market doesn't even notice. Relative to your needs, there will almost always be plenty of any particular stock available to buy or sell at the current market price at any given time.
When you're trying to put a few hundred million or even a couple billion dollars into a particular equity though -- as Buffett typically is -- it catches people's attention. In some cases, it can even meaningfully move a stock's price, perhaps unwinding the pullback that made the stock so attractive in the first place.
Don't misunderstand. The prospect of moving the market doesn't prevent the Oracle of Omaha from steering Berkshire into or out of trades. But the conglomerate has to be smart and patient in how it moves. You don't, so you can buy all the shares you want to (finances permitting), whenever you want to, on most pullbacks.
Of course, this assumes you're actually willing to step into new positions on their way down rather than waiting until they're on their way back up... which you should be. The key is pre-picking your preferred price point and sticking to it. As Buffett himself has even said, ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price"" -- even though he often has to fight for that fair price. Precision-timing the entry misses the point.
3. Learn about different industries and diversify your holdings
Finally, perhaps the most overlooked liability of the Berkshire stock portfolio is that, at any given time, it's not particularly well diversified.
Of the $323 billion worth of equities currently owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Apple accounts for 40% of the collective value. Financial stocks like Bank of America, American Express (NYSE: AXP), and U.S. Bank (NYSE: USB) make up another quarter of the portfolio -- and that doesn't count the financial services firms among the conglomerate's wholly owned subsidiaries, such as Geico Insurance or Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance. Buffett is also heavily exposed to industrial names, both publicly traded players and Berkshire-owned companies like Lubrizol and several railroad-related businesses.
Conversely, he's arguably underexposed to technology stocks, materials, healthcare, and consumer-facing companies.

That's not a fatal flaw. Buffett has often touted the investing philosophy of ""buy what you know,"" which is wise. His acolytes aren't straying too far from that advice, though they may know more about certain businesses than Buffett does.
But it's not as if this willingness to concentrate his portfolio too much in familiar industries hasn't occasionally come back to haunt him. Berkshire took a bath on its investments in Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL), which it sold early last year when the pandemic first rattled markets. Less exposure to the air travel industry would have reduced the pain the portfolio suffered in the first half of 2020, and perhaps prevented Berkshire Hathaway from underperforming the S&P 500 last year.
You should still understand the business model of any company you buy. But, rather than eschewing unfamiliar businesses, it might be smart to learn about some new ones so you can spread your risk out across more sectors.

American Airlines AAL was also in the news, courtesy of its management’s decision to expand its regional operations. To this end, AAL inked a five-year deal with Air Wisconsin. Meanwhile, JetBlue Airways JBLU reportedly announced some route cuts to ensure operational efficiency.
AAL also grabbed the headlines recently when it inked a deal with Boom Supersonic to purchase up to 20 Overture planes from the latter. The story was reported in detail in the previous week’s write-up.
Recap of the Latest Top Stories
1. Ryanair now expects passenger volumes for fiscal 2023 to be 166.5 million. The previous expectation was 165 million. Ryanair augmented its UK capacity by adding one million plus seats to/from 20 airports in the UK.
The raised forecast is owing to management’s decision to boost the airline’s UK winter schedule following a reduction in the winter schedule capacity of its rival British Airways. RYAAY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2. With an eye on maintaining its operations to small markets, American Airlines announced that Air Wisconsin will be part of the American Eagle family by March 2023 in the face of acute pilot crisis. Air Wisconsin’s fleet will start operating for American Eagle within next March. American Eagle is a network of multiple regional carriers that operate under a codeshare and service pact with AAL.
Per the terms of the deal, Air Wisconsin will be responsible for operating up to 60 aircraft of its fleet of 50-seat CRJ-200s, primarily from AAL’s hub at the Chicago - O’Hare International. Currently, Air Wisconsin operates flights for United Airlines UAL from the latter’s (Chicago-based carrier) hubs at O’Hare and Dulles International Airports. Air Wisconsin’s partnership with UAL is likely to come to an end, in accordance with its terms.
3. Management at JetBlue decided to trim its network by terminating services to some destinations. To this end, JBLU decided to stop its nonstop flights from San Francisco International Airport to Newark after Sep 6, 2022.  Per a statement issued by the management, “To ensure continued operational reliability, we’re planning a schedule change for this fall and into 2023 that will extend some of the market suspensions we put in place earlier this year,”
4. Per a CNBC report, the U.S. administration decided to suspend 26 flights to China from the United States by four Chinese carriers, namely Xiamen, Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. The decision, which will impact flights from Sep 5 to Sep 28, follows a similar ruling from the Chinese government, whereby 26 U.S.-bound flights by Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines were suspended due to COVID-19 cases.

52.0,2023-08-16 00:00:00 UTC,TD Cowen Maintains Agilent Technologies (A) Outperform Recommendation,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/td-cowen-maintains-agilent-technologies-a-outperform-recommendation-0,,,"Fintel reports that on August 16, 2023, TD Cowen maintained coverage of Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) with a Outperform recommendation.
Analyst Price Forecast Suggests 14.32% Upside
As of August 2, 2023, the average one-year price target for Agilent Technologies is 143.65. The forecasts range from a low of 116.15 to a high of $171.15. The average price target represents an increase of 14.32% from its latest reported closing price of 125.65.
See our leaderboard of companies with the largest price target upside.
The projected annual revenue for Agilent Technologies is 7,130MM, an increase of 1.94%. The projected annual non-GAAP EPS is 5.77.
Agilent Technologies Declares $0.22 Dividend
On May 17, 2023 the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share ($0.90 annualized). Shareholders of record as of July 3, 2023 received the payment on July 26, 2023. Previously, the company paid $0.22 per share.
At the current share price of $125.65 / share, the stock's dividend yield is 0.72%.
Looking back five years and taking a sample every week, the average dividend yield has been 0.73%, the lowest has been 0.44%, and the highest has been 1.14%. The standard deviation of yields is 0.15 (n=235).
The current dividend yield is 0.10 standard deviations below the historical average.
Additionally, the company's dividend payout ratio is 0.23. The payout ratio tells us how much of a company's income is paid out in dividends. A payout ratio of one (1.0) means 100% of the company's income is paid in a dividend. A payout ratio greater than one means the company is dipping into savings in order to maintain its dividend - not a healthy situation. Companies with few growth prospects are expected to pay out most of their income in dividends, which typically means a payout ratio between 0.5 and 1.0. Companies with good growth prospects are expected to retain some earnings in order to invest in those growth prospects, which translates to a payout ratio of zero to 0.5.
The company's 3-Year dividend growth rate is 0.25%, demonstrating that it has increased its dividend over time.

1837.0,2010-10-07 00:00:00 UTC,Earnings Season: How to Watch Your Step,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earnings-season-how-watch-your-step-2010-10-07,,,"Stories that involve good advice tend to get re-told, and the ones with real value pop up again and again.
One of my favorites is the story of the legendary admiral who has a lock-box in his stateroom. Every day before he takes the bridge, he opens the lock-box, takes out a small piece of paper, reads it and puts it back.
Over the years, this quirk is noticed by many people, and there's lots of speculation about what's on the paper: an inspirational quote, a personal sentiment or some gritty piece of military advice?
When the admiral dies, his executors open the lock-box and read the paper.
It says ""Port is Left, Starboard is Right.""
I've heard this story at least three times, and in one telling it was a merchant captain, in another an unnamed admiral, and in the third, a specific admiral of some fame.
But while the information on the slip of paper would undoubtedly be useful for a man in charge of a ship, I've never seriously considered that the story might be true. (Although I'd love to be wrong; let me know if you have any supporting evidence.)
As someone who plies the sometimes choppy waters of the stock markets, I know that there are similar sentiments that can help put things in perspective.
If I had to look at one little piece of paper every morning, I'd probably put:
""Remember: When markets are going up, you're not a genius. When markets go down, you're not an idiot.""

With earnings season just beginning- Alcoa ( AA ) is the traditional first reporter, and it's announcing results today (October 7) after the NYSE closes-there will be plenty of both agony and ecstasy to go around. And that will make it even more important than usual to keep your emotional equilibrium.
I know that taking an earnings hit can be very painful. I've had personal holdings that dropped up to 25% after a disappointing earnings report. The stocks that have been the strongest (which means they had attracted the most hot money) usually drop farther and faster than more sedate issues. And I felt like an idiot for not taking profits the day before the earnings announcement.
So here are a few observations on earnings season to help you maintain an even keel as the news gaps stocks both up and down with no warning.
1) It's Not the Number, It's the Expected Number. If all companies had to do to stay in favor with investors was to keep growing revenue and earnings, quarterly reports would be a piece of cake. But investors pay close attention to the earnings estimates provided by analysts, who, in turn, get to set the bar where they think a company should perform. So a company can lose money and still ""beat expectations"" by losing less than analysts thought it would and investors will view that as a victory and bid the stock up. But even a 100% jump in earnings can kill a stock if analysts had predicted 101%.
2) Companies Make Predictions, Too. Even if a company comes up to the mark on revenue and earnings, it can get dinged because its projections for results in the next quarter (or year) are subpar. The result is often as bad as for an earnings miss.
3) Stormy Weather Is Expected. After the rosy Q2 results that put a booster seat under investors' confidence, advance guidance for the Q3 season has been running about two-to-one to the downside. Among S&P 500 stocks, pre-announcements now total 77 on the negative side and 34 on the positive side.
4) Don't Fight the Chart. A stock that disappoints on revenue or earnings or guidance or margins or anything and gaps down huge on above-average volume should probably be sold. Big damage that shows up in a stock's chart can take a long time to heal. You may be able to pick up a few points by waiting for the bounce that sometimes follows a big down day, but statistically, you're better off selling than waiting for the stock to get going again.
5) Catch a Rising Star. On the upside, a big gap up on volume typically gives a stock a head of steam that will continue to push the price higher. So don't let a big gain in a stock that soars on good results keep you from jumping on the bandwagon. Stocks get good mileage out of good results.
6) Keep a Razor Edge on Your Sell Disciplines. I've said this before, but it's too important not to repeat. When you buy a stock, you should calculate your 15% and 20% loss limits and write them down where you can see them. This will help you to keep your head when bad news hits. If a stock hands you a 20% loss from your buy price at the close of trading, kick it out!
Here's to a great earnings season with positive surprises in each and every one of your holdings (and mine, too, as long as we're ordering up good luck)! And as always, I will be rooting for the stocks in the portfolio of the Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report, most of which have scheduled their announcements for November, as is typical for smaller, emerging market stocks. I'll tell all of my subscribers how to handle the ups and downs for each holding, and I'd be glad to tell you, too. A quick click right here will get you started on a guided tour of the hottest markets on earth.

If you take the responsibility seriously, recommending any stock is a genuine risk. After all, mutual fund managers who can pick 51% winners-even with all the research and analysis resources in the world-are considered real gunslingers. For me, if a stock doesn't meet all of my requirements, it goes on the Watch List, not into the portfolio.
That's why I won't be recommending 51job ( JOBS ) , the Chinese recruiting and human resource company, for the readers of Cabot China & Emerging Markets Report.
The company has lots of things going for it, including its admirable earnings line (up 300%, 233% and 120% from terrible 2008/09 levels) and revenue growth (gains of 15%, 43% and 37%). After-tax profit margins have been over 20% for the latest four quarters, with an juicy 24.9% in the latest quarter. And earnings estimates are running at $1.14 per share for 2010, well up from $0.73 in 2009.
51job is a pretty seasoned company for China, founded in 1998 and based in Shanghai, which is the heart of China's commercial zone. The company serves both potential employers and job seekers, using both online and print media. The 51job Weekly is a recruiting publication that's customized for particular cities and distributed in newspapers or as a stand-alone. 51job also offers executive search and business process outsourcing services, and will train clients in job skills from secretarial and manufacturing to management and financial planning.
JOBS has been on a roll since April 2009, with a seven-month basing period from December 2009 to July 2010 under resistance at 20. The blastoff from that base began in July, but really picked up speed (and volume support) in September.
All in all, it's a great package, and the prospects for the company are excellent as China's need for better-trained employees and executive talent heats up. 51job is a very direct play on the growth of China's domestic economy.
So what's the problem? It's the discouragingly low volume the stock trades at. With only an average of 150,000 shares changing hands per day, the stock's volatility is just too high to recommend to a large group of people. It's an appropriate vehicle for the nimble individual investor, but its float of seven million shares will have to increase to make it attractive to institutional investors … and to me, of course.
Sincerely,

3271.0,2022-09-08 00:00:00 UTC,Boeing Stock Is A Better Pick Over This Aerospace & Defense Company,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/boeing-stock-is-a-better-pick-over-this-aerospace-defense-company,,,"We believe that Boeing stock (NYSE: BA) is currently a better pick than Raytheon Technologies stock (NYSE: RTX), given its better prospects. Although BA stock is trading at a comparatively lower valuation of 1.5x trailing revenues vs. 2.0x for Raytheon, this gap in the valuation of these two companies is justified given Raytheon’s superior revenue growth and profitability, as discussed below.
Looking at stock returns, Raytheon has fared better than BA and the broader indices. RTX stock is up 2% YTD, BA is down 25%, and the S&P500 index has declined 18%. While both companies will likely see top-line expansion over the coming years, Boeing is expected to outperform. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we believe BA stock will offer better returns than RTX stock in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation multiple in an interactive dashboard analysis of Boeing vs. Raytheon Technologies: Which Stock Is A Better Bet? Parts of the analysis are summarized below.
1. Raytheon’s Revenue Growth Is Better
Raytheon’s revenue growth of 4.8% over the last twelve months is better than a 1.5% fall in Boeing’s sales.
Looking at a longer time frame, Boeing’s sales declined at an average rate of 13.7% to $62.3 billion in 2021, compared to $101.1 billion in 2018, while Raytheon saw its sales rise at an average growth rate of 23.1% to $64.4 billion in 2021, compared to $34.7 billion in 2018.
The revenue decline for Boeing can primarily be attributed to the impact of the 737 Max grounding in 2019 and the Covid-19 pandemic on the company’s businesses, given that commercial airlines was one of the worst-hit sectors during the coronavirus crisis.
Commercial Airplanes was the largest segment for Boeing, accounting for 57% of total sales in 2018, but the contribution dropped to 31% in 2021. Defense, Space & Security Systems is now the largest segment for the company, accounting for 42% of the total sales.
Boeing, over the recent past, has struggled to ramp up its production, impacting its deliveries. Supply chain disruption and labor issues for some of its suppliers further added to its woes.
Raytheon has undergone significant restructuring over recent years. United Technologies merged with Raytheon to form Raytheon Technologies in 2020. Furthermore, it spun off its OTIS and Carrier businesses, making Raytheon purely an aerospace and defense-focused company.
Raytheon’s commercial airplane business was also hit during the pandemic weighing on its commercial OEM and aftermarket sales.
However, there are near-term headwinds for both companies. The current high inflationary environment, rising interest rates, and fears of a slowing economy have weighed on the broader markets. Boeing is focused on increasing its overall production, and this, clubbed with its new orders, including a $13 billion order from Delta, will likely support its revenue growth.
Our Boeing Revenue and Raytheon Technologies Revenue dashboards provide more insight into the companies’ sales.
Looking forward, Boeing’s revenue is expected to grow faster than Raytheon’s over the next three years. The table below summarizes our revenue expectations for the two companies over the next three years. It points to a CAGR of 9.9% for Boeing, compared to just a 1.6% CAGR for Raytheon, based on Trefis Machine Learning analysis.
Note that we have different methodologies for companies that are negatively impacted by Covid and those that are not impacted or positively impacted by Covid while forecasting future revenues. For companies negatively affected by Covid, we consider the quarterly revenue recovery trajectory to forecast recovery to the pre-Covid revenue run rate. Beyond the recovery point, we apply the average annual growth observed three years before Covid to simulate a return to normal conditions. For companies registering positive revenue growth during Covid, we consider yearly average growth before Covid with a certain weight to growth during Covid and the last twelve months.
2. Raytheon Is More Profitable
Boeing’s operating margin of -2.7% over the last twelve months is far worse than 11.7% for Raytheon.
This compares with -1.6% and 16.2% figures seen in 2019, before the pandemic, respectively.
Raytheon’s free cash flow margin of 10.5% is also better than the -4.4% for Boeing.
Our Boeing Operating Income and Raytheon Technologies Operating Income dashboards have more details.
Looking at financial risk, Boeing’s 62.5% debt as a percentage of equity is much higher than 24.2% for Raytheon, while its 8.5% cash as a percentage of assets is higher than 3.0% for the latter, implying that Raytheon has a better debt position, but Boeing has more cash cushion.
3. The Net of It All
We see that Raytheon has demonstrated better revenue growth, is more profitable, and has a better debt position. On the other hand, Boeing has more cash cushion and is available at a relatively lower valuation.
Now, looking at prospects, using P/S as a base, due to high fluctuations in P/E and P/EBIT, we believe Boeing is currently the better choice of the two.
The table below summarizes our revenue and return expectation for both companies over the next three years and points to an expected return of 48% for Boeing over this period vs. a 4% expected return for Raytheon stock, implying that investors are better off buying BA over RTX, based on Trefis Machine Learning analysis – Boeing vs. Raytheon Technologies – which also provides more details on how we arrive at these numbers.
While BA stock looks like it can offer better returns over RTX stock, it is helpful to see how Boeing’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.
Furthermore, the Covid-19 crisis has created many pricing discontinuities which can offer attractive trading opportunities. For example, you’ll be surprised at how counter-intuitive the stock valuation is for Vicor vs. Williams Sonoma.
With inflation rising and the Fed raising interest rates, among other factors, Boeing stock has fallen 25% this year. Can it drop more? See how low Boeing stock can go by comparing its decline in previous market crashes. Here is a performance summary of all stocks in previous market crashes.

The revenue decline for Boeing can primarily be attributed to the impact of the 737 Max grounding in 2019 and the Covid-19 pandemic on the company’s businesses, given that commercial airlines was one of the worst-hit sectors during the coronavirus crisis. The current high inflationary environment, rising interest rates, and fears of a slowing economy have weighed on the broader markets.","Looking at a longer time frame, Boeing’s sales declined at an average rate of 13.7% to $62.3 billion in 2021, compared to $101.1 billion in 2018, while Raytheon saw its sales rise at an average growth rate of 23.1% to $64.4 billion in 2021, compared to $34.7 billion in 2018. The table below summarizes our revenue and return expectation for both companies over the next three years and points to an expected return of 48% for Boeing over this period vs. a 4% expected return for Raytheon stock, implying that investors are better off buying BA over RTX, based on Trefis Machine Learning analysis – Boeing vs. Raytheon Technologies – which also provides more details on how we arrive at these numbers.

2420.0,2023-07-20 00:00:00 UTC,"Q2 Beats for J&J, American; Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Lower",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/q2-beats-for-jj-american-jobless-claims-philly-fed-lower,,,"Today being Thursday, we see new Initial Jobless Claims for last week hitting the tape. These numbers continue to surprise to the downside, putting up 228K new claims; a range of 230-240K were expected by analysts. Today’s headline is the lowest tally since cycle lows in mid-May of 225K. Up until the middle of last month, initial claims had been nudging higher — over 260+ three weeks in a row — which seemed to match headwinds in the overall labor market. Yet employment apparently remains uncommonly resilient.

Similarly with Continuing Claims (reported a week in arrears from new claims): 1.754 million, while up +33K from the slightly downwardly revised 1.722 million the previous week, are still lower than analyst estimates and remain stubbornly below 1.8 million — now the case for the 10th straight week. While this resiliency is very good in guarding our economy against recession, it is also fodder for the Fed to consider continuing to raise interest rates to more fully snuff out inflation, which strong employment tends to promote.

Also in today’s pre-market, a new Philly Fed survey is out: -13.5 makes it 11 straight negative prints for this productivity metric for the sixth-biggest city in the U.S. While off cycle lows of -31.3 back in April of this year, it is nevertheless the second-straight month sub-13. Following an Empire State read earlier this week that was also lower, we are seeing a slowing in manufacturing which is consistent with a slowing economy — again bringing the Fed’s decisions into focus. This looks to be the fulcrum for the Fed to consider: higher employment versus lower productivity.

Johnson & Johnson JNJ is out with Q2 earnings results ahead of today’s open, with solid beats on the top-line — $25.53 billion in revenues, +3.43% over the Zacks consensus — and bottom: earnings of $2.80 per share, +7.28% above expectations. Strength in its MedTech space was a catalyst for the healthcare giant, and as a result, J&J has increased its full-year guidance projections. Shares are up slightly on the news, but still down nearly -10% year to date, vastly underperforming the markets. For more on JNJ’s earnings, click here.

American Airlines AAL similarly left Q2 estimates in the dust this morning: earnings of $1.92 per share on all-time record quarterly revenues of $14.06 billion for the quarter easily surpassed the $1.58 per share and $13.74 billion expected. Full-year earnings guidance was increased on the top-end to a range of $3.00-3.75 per share. Yet shares are trading -1.5% on the news, as some airfares are reportedly coming down (peak airfare now passed?) and questions about a new labor deal for American pilots currently lie in the cut.

After the opening bell this morning, we’ll take a look at June Existing Home Sales, which are expected to tick down slightly to 4.2 million — basically in-line with the previous few months, but well below the 5+ million existing home sales numbers we were seeing back in June of last year. Also, Leading Economic Indicators for June are expected to prove incrementally to -0.6% fro -0.7% reported a month ago.

Flights to Tel Aviv from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, Larnaca in Cyprus and Varna in Bulgaria were cancelled on Friday, Wizz Air's website showed.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has warned airlines to monitor heightened tensions in Israel, including exchanges of rocket fire and air strikes. ""The situation in the region remains a matter of high concern for commercial aviation,"" it said in a bulletin to airlines on Wednesday.
Emirati carrier flydubai was to operate three of four scheduled flights from Dubai to Tel Aviv on Friday, and two of four scheduled services on Saturday, its website showed.
An airline spokeswoman said fewer flights were being operated due to a drop in demand.
Other airlines including British Airways ICAG.L and American Airlines AAL.O cancelled flights to Tel Aviv earlier in the week.
Palestinian militants have repeatedly shelled the Tel Aviv area during hostilities that erupted on Monday, raising safety concerns about Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's main airport, and prompting some carriers to reroute flights to Ramon Airport, some 200 km (125 miles) to the south, near the Red Sea city of Eilat.

4466.0,2021-05-17 00:00:00 UTC,U.S. airlines add COVID-tested flights to Italy as country reopens to tourists,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-airlines-add-covid-tested-flights-to-italy-as-country-reopens-to-tourists-2021-05-17,,,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO, May 17 (Reuters) - United Airlines UAL.O, Delta Air Lines DAL.N and American Airlines AAL.O are adding flights to Italy with protocols for coronavirus testing as the country opens to leisure travelers from the United States for the first time in more than a year.
On Sunday, the Italian government eased a number of COVID-19 travel restrictions and requirements as it looks to boost summer tourism, including scrapping a mandatory quarantine for visitors from certain countries as long as they test negative for COVID-19.
As a result, United on Monday joined Delta and American in announcing additional COVID-tested flights to the popular European travel spot, which had been closed to tourists from countries including the United States, Canada and Japan.
The three U.S. airlines have multiple nonstop options to Rome and Milan and Delta plans to add nonstop flights to Venice from New York in July and from Atlanta in August.
U.S. travelers to Italy must take a COVID-19 test no more than 48 hours before boarding and again on arrival. If negative, they will be exempted from quarantine.
To return to the United States, travelers must present a negative test taken no more than 72 hours before departure, even if they have been vaccinated.
Airlines have lobbied for COVID-tested flights as a path to restart international travel, which has been severely restricted as governments seek to contain coronavirus infections.
As cases decline in parts of the world with effective vaccination campaigns, the European Union's executive has recommended easing COVID-19 travel restrictions to let foreign travelers from more countries enter the bloc, which at times has struggled to agree on a common response to the pandemic.
The United States continues to ban entry of non-U.S. citizens arriving from most of Europe, despite growing calls from airline industry leaders to speed the reopening of transatlantic travel.

807.0,2022-04-18 00:00:00 UTC,Will Alumina and Bauxite Benefit Alcoa's (AA) Q1 Earnings?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-alumina-and-bauxite-benefit-alcoas-aa-q1-earnings,,,"Alcoa Corporation AA is set to release first-quarter 2022 results on Apr 20, after market close.

The company’s Bauxite segment is engaged in bauxite mining operations and processes bauxite into alumina with the help of the bayer process to sell it to customers.

The company’s Alumina segment comprises its refining system, which is used for processing bauxite into alumina.
Key Factors to Note
In the past few quarters, the Bauxite segment’s performance has been strengthening Alcoa’s revenues. It has been gaining primarily from the increased demand for bauxite from its own refineries and third-party customers. Also, its focus on improving operational efficiency supported by its pricing actions is anticipated to have aided the segment in the to-be-reported quarter. However, lower shipment volume for bauxite and supply-chain challenges might have affected its performance.

For the first quarter of 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Bauxite segment’s revenues is pegged at $234 million, suggesting a 3.7% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported number and a 9.3% fall from the previous quarter’s figure.

The company’s project for high purity alumina production and its efforts to offer new products, cost-saving actions and solid orders are likely to have aided Alumina segment’s performance in the first quarter. Growing popularity for the company’s Sustana and EcoSource line of products, supported by higher prices, is likely to have boosted its performance in the quarter. However, higher raw materials and energy costs might have affected its margins.

For the first quarter of 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate Alumina segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,307 million, suggesting growth of 16.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number but a 10.8% decrease from the previous quarter’s figure.

Revenues advanced 12.6% year over year to $807.2 million. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $753.9 million.

Top-line growth was driven by accelerating services and marketplace revenues. Moreover, strong momentum across the company’s marketplace during the holiday shopping season contributed well.

1289.0,2013-10-07 00:00:00 UTC,"Stock Market News for October 7, 2013 - Market News",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-news-for-october-7-2013-market-news-2013-10-07,,,"Benchmarks posted modest gains of Friday even as the partial government shutdown continued. Friday's gains were primarily driven by hopes that lawmakers will conclude a deal on the ongoing budget issue and on increasing the country's debt limit. Despite Friday's gains, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 ended in the red. Nonetheless, the Nasdaq finished in the green for the fifth week in a row. Meanwhile, the third quarter earnings season is slated to kick off this week. Due to the government shutdown, the widely awaited nonfarm payrolls report was not released on Friday. All ten sectors of the S&P 500 industry groups finished in the green, led by materials and energy stocks.
For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's Ahead of Wall Street article
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.5% to close the day at 15,072.58. The S&P 500 added 0.7% to finish Friday's trading session at 1,690.50. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.9% to end at 3,807.75. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined 5.3% to settle at 16.74. Consolidated volumes on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were roughly 5.2 billion shares, considerably lower than 2013's average of 6.1 billion shares. Advancing stocks outnumbered the decliners. For 64% shares that advanced, only 33% declined.
The Dow slipped 1.2%, the S&P 500 declined 0.1% and the Nasdaq rose 0.7%, over the week. Weakness in the S&P 500 and the blue-chip index was primarily due to political altercations over the ongoing budget issue. Investors are not only concerned about the government shutdown, but are even more worried about the country's debt ceiling deadline. If lawmakers fail to reach a deal on the budget within the next few days, they might miss the debt ceiling deadline.
Stocks kicked off Friday's trading session on a positive note and traded higher for most of the trading session. But stocks trimmed some gains after Speaker John Boehner said the Congress will not vote on a spending bill without conditions to end the government shutdown. He also demanded spending cuts to raise the government's debt limit. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama cancelled his trip to Indonesia. According to the White House: ""The president made this decision based on the difficulty in moving forward with foreign travel in the face of a shutdown, and his determination to continue pressing his case that Republicans should immediately allow a vote to reopen the government.""
IMF chief Christine Lagarde said the global economy will be affected if U.S lawmakers fail to raise the government borrowing limit by October 17. Lagarde added that the U.S. growth rate can fall below 2% in 2013. Due to the government shutdown nonfarm, payroll numbers were not released on Friday. According to the consensus estimate, nonfarm payroll numbers were expected to increase by 183,000 from the previous month's figure of 169,000.
The third quarter earnings season will unofficially begin this week. Major companies like Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE: YUM ), Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA ) are scheduled to post quarterly results on Friday. Financial bellwether JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM ) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC ) are slated to report results on Friday.
The materials sector was the biggest gainer among the S&P 500 industry groups and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) gained 1.5%. Stocks such as Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON ), Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE: APD ), The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE: DOW ), Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE: SHW ) and Mosaic Co (NYSE: MOS ) added 0.5%, 0.8%, 3.2%, 2.0% and 1.8%, respectively.
The energy sector also had a good day and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) gained 1.0%. Stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM ), Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES ), ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP ), Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE: MUR ) and Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO ) increased 1.0%, 0.3%, 1.1%, 1.8% and 2.1%, respectively.

3894.0,2022-01-06 00:00:00 UTC,U.S. flights still face risks from new 5G service -FAA,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-flights-still-face-risks-from-new-5g-service-faa,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday issued fresh warnings that new 5G wireless service could still disrupt flights, saying there were ""big differences"" between U.S. aviation protections and those used in France.
Late Thursday, the FAA launched a dedicated webpage on 5G and aviation safety raising questions about potential impact on sensitive airplane electronics like altimeters.
This week, AT&T and Verizon agreed to adopt similar precautions to those in France. On Monday, the carriers said they would delay use of C-Band spectrum for wireless service until Jan. 19 -- an agreement aimed at heading off an aviation safety crisis and flight disruptions.
On Tuesday, President Joe Biden hailed the deal between wireless carriers and U.S. regulators allowing 5G deployment in two weeks. The FAA said the delay would allow it to evaluate ways to minimize disruptions to altimeters, and also gives companies more time to prepare.
The FAA said 5G airport buffer zones in France cover ""96 seconds of flight"" while safety precautions around U.S. airports ""only protect the last 20 seconds of flight."" It said temporary U.S. lower power levels will be 2.5 times higher than France. It noted that France requires antennas be tilted downward to limit harmful interference, a rule the United States lacks.
""If there’s the possibility of a risk to the flying public, we are obligated to pause the activity, until we can prove it is safe,"" the FAA website said. ""Radar altimeters still must be proven safe in the overall U.S. 5G environment to fly into these airports, so we must take into account the higher signal strength when assessing safety and risk.""
AT&T and Verizon won nearly all of the C-Band spectrum in an $80-billion auction last year. The FAA in early November issued a bulletin warning action may be needed to address potential interference from 5G, which prompted the carriers to agree to delay deployment for 30 days to Jan. 5.
The deal Monday assured AT&T and Verizon they will be able to start service this month and they agreed to temporary buffer zones around 50 airports that the FAA will identify by Friday.
The FAA website said 50 airports are covered because the ""wireless companies only agreed to 50 airports."" AT&T and Verizon did not immediately comment.
Biden said the agreement ""puts us on track to substantially reduce disruptions to air operations"" after Jan. 19.
The FAA said that ""even with the temporary buffer around 50 airports, 5G deployment will increase the risk of disruption during low visibility"" including ""flight cancellations, diverted flights, and delays during periods of low visibility.""
The FAA said it is working during the two-week delay ""to complete evaluations of the most popular altimeters allowing some aircraft to operate in 5G and minimize disruptions.""

LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Online industrial metals platforms are gaining momentum this year by targeting the physical trade of minerals worth about half a trillion dollars a year, gradually enticing traders to move away from largely paper-based systems.
The digital venues have attracted traders as London Metal Exchange volumes fell after the coronavirus pandemic temporarily closed its floor for open outcry trading in March 2020. See FACTBOX:
As the metals industry gathers in person for LME Week starting on Monday, the digital venues are also tapping into the global move towards sustainability by embedding traceable data about sourcing and CO2 emissions into their systems.
Investors have shown confidence in the new online platforms, with MineHub MHUB.V listing in Canada last month and Swiss-based Open Mineral's $33 million fundraising including Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund Mubadala.
Germany's Metalshub is set to more than triple turnover this year to 1 billion euros, attracting big clients such as miner Anglo American AAL.L.
""The metal industry is just painfully slow in adapting to technology,"" Chief Executive Frank Jackel of Metalshub told Reuters in an interview.
""But they now see it's making life much easier. Efficiency is one key factor and there's a huge compliance advantage.""
BLOCKCHAIN, LOGISTICS
MineHub and TradeCloud in Singapore are seeking to digitise trade finance and logistics in metals and mining by using blockchain, a digital ledger.
MineHub provides services after deals have been agreed, similar to the fulfilment services by Amazon, Chief Executive Arnoud Busmann told Reuters.
""After the Amazon one-click, all the hard work starts - logistics, customs, payments - that's the bit that we do.""
The platforms have succeeded in targeting physical trading as exchanges such as CME Group Inc CME.O and the LME 0388.HK largely cater for financial investors.
The exchanges include the option of physical delivery, but more than 99% of LME trades are financially settled.
Metalshub mainly deals in ferro-alloys used in the steel industry, which are not listed on the main exchanges. But its second most traded product is nickel, which is traded on the LME.
The platforms are attracting major companies, including the world's biggest listed mining group BHP BHPB.L, which signed up in April to become a user of MineHub after using it for its first blockchain trade in iron ore a year earlier.
Big firms using Metalshub include Anglo American and Finnish stainless steel producer Outokumpu OUT1V.HE.

4335.0,2021-07-15 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines Lifts Q2 Guidance; Shares Soar,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-lifts-q2-guidance-shares-soar-2021-07-15,,,"Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) soared 3% to close at $20.62 on July 14, following the news that the company is lifting its Q2 guidance ahead of its earnings. AAL also stated that it is expecting to report its first positive quarter post-pandemic.
AAL credited factors such as continued momentum in travel demand and forward bookings for its positive outlook. American flew 44 million passengers during the quarter, up 83% from the first quarter and more than five times that of the year-ago period. (See American Airlines stock charts on TipRanks)
The sector was one of the worst-hit when nationwide borders and global travel came to a standstill owing to the pandemic. However, the sector is recovering steadily with the strong vaccine rollout and easing of travel restrictions.
In Q2, the company expects to report revenue of $7.475 billion, and earnings (excluding net special items) are expected to be in the range of $(1.67) to $(1.76) per share. The Streets’ estimates for revenue and earnings are pegged at $7.14 billion and $(2.41) per share.
Additionally, the company forecast an average daily cash build of $1 million, showing a significant improvement over an average daily cash burn of $27 million reported in the first quarter. The company also expects to report approximately $21.3 billion in total available liquidity at quarter-end.
The company’s CEO Doug Parker said, “Our revenue and expense performance in the quarter came in better than expectations, and this was achieved while bringing the operation back up to full capacity and safely transporting a record number of travelers.” 
On July 13, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu maintained a Hold rating on the stock and assigned a price target of $24, implying 16.4% upside potential to current levels.
Kahyaoglu said, “Our Hold rating balances our belief that AAL may be the best positioned of the network carriers with the youngest fleet and a strong competitive positioning through its network, with the restrictive nature of AAL's leverage keeping us on the side-line.”
The stock has an overall Hold consensus rating based on 2 Buys, 4 Holds, and 4 Sells. The average American Airlines price target of $20.83 implies 1% upside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 53.4% over the past year.
According to TipRanks’ Smart Score system, American Airlines gets a 5 out of 10, which indicates that the stock is likely to perform in line with market averages.

4918.0,2020-12-09 00:00:00 UTC,Why American Airlines Stock Popped 5% This Morning,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-american-airlines-stock-popped-5-this-morning-2020-12-09,,,"What happened
Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) took flight this morning, rising 5.7% in apparent response to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday in which it disclosed that publicly traded investment manager BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) now holds a 4.8% stake in the company.
If that is the reason investors are buying American Airlines stock today, figuring BlackRock knows something that the rest of us do not, then they may be making a big mistake.
Image source: American Airlines.
So what
Digging into the company's filings on the SEC's website, it turns out that yesterday's report is not the first mention of BlackRock's ownership stake in American. In fact, the most recent filing prior to this one, from April 2020, showed that BlackRock owned a 5.5% stake in the airline.
And prior to that, BlackRock's stake was 5.3%, in February.
Now what
Viewed in context of these previous reports, therefore, it appears that what is happening here is not what investors think is happening -- i.e., BlackRock taking a new position in American, indicating optimism about the stock and perhaps about the prospects for airline stocks in general. Rather, it appears that BlackRock, having held a sizable stake in American Airlines all through the pandemic, is now beginning to pull out of the stock.
If what you are aiming to do today, therefore, is to imitate the smart money, then what you really might want to do is sell shares of American Airlines. And in fact, with the share price gains now pared to 2.5% as of 10:45 a.m. EST, this might be just what investors are doing.

1197.0,2014-02-18 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa Closing Point Henry Smelter & Mills in Australia - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-closing-point-henry-smelter-mills-in-australia-analyst-blog-2014-02-18,,,"Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) announced that it will permanently shut down its Point Henry aluminum smelter and two rolling mills in Australia by the end of 2014.
Alcoa had put the Point Henry smelter under strategic review since 2012 due to the challenging market conditions and found that the smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable. The smelter, which employed about 500 people, will close in Aug 2014. Once the Point Henry closure is complete, Alcoa will have a total smelting operating capacity of around 3,760,000 metric tons, with roughly 655,000 metric tons, or 17% of high cost capacity offline.
The two rolling mills, which cater to the domestic and Asian can sheet markets, have been impacted by excess capacity. The mills, employing about 480 people, are expected to close by the end of 2014.
Alcoa will incur restructuring charges in 2014 related to the closures. These charges are expected to be in the range of $250 million-$270 million after-tax and non-controlling interest, or 22 cents to 25 cents per share, of which roughly 60% would be recorded in the first quarter.
Alcoa's global smelting capacity will be reduced by 190,000 metric tons following the closures and the company's can sheet capacity will also decrease by 200,000 metric tons. Including the closure of the Point Henry smelter, Alcoa has announced closures or curtailments of about 551,000 metric tons of smelting capacity, exceeding the 460,000 metric tons placed under review in May 2013.
Alcoa also announced that it will seek a buyer for the Anglesea coal mine and power station, which currently provide 40% of the power needs for the Point Henry smelter. The company announced that its Portland smelter in Victoria will continue to operate, along with its Australian bauxite mining and Western Australia state alumina refining operations.
Alcoa is making capital investments and remains on track to move down the cost curve and curtail capacities in its upstream business. The curtailments will improve the competitiveness of the company's Primary Products business.
Alcoa, a prominent player in the mining industry along with Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd. ( ACH ), Atlatsa Resources Corp. ( ATL ) and BHP Billiton Ltd. ( BHP ), is a world leader in production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina.
Alcoa currently retains a short-term Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

A Trader's Take :
""Alcoa ( AA ) got the headlines today, but I'm more impressed by what was going on under the surface. Danaher (DHR) is a company three times the size of AA, and they upped their fourth-quarter guidance,"" Detrick noted. ""At the same time, Seagate Technology ( STX ), Constellation Brands ( STZ ), and Stryker (SYK) all had positive things to say about earnings. When you consider just how low some of the overall expectations are as we begin this earnings season,"" he added, ""one has to wonder if the analysts have once again become too bearish. This will make it much easier for companies to clear the lowered earnings bar.""
3 Things to Know About Today's Market :
President Barack Obama reportedly plans to nominate current White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew to the U.S. Treasury secretary role currently held by Timothy Geithner, who wishes to exit the position by mid-month. An anonymous source broke this news today ahead of the official nomination, which is expected to come as soon as tomorrow. Mr. Lew, 57, has a long history in Washington, serving as aide to Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill in the 1980s and budget advisor to President Clinton in the 1990s.
As quickly as they started, reports that American International Group (AIG) would latch on to a shareholder lawsuit against the U.S. government were laid to rest. The board met today and decided against taking part in the $25-billion suit, which was originally filed by former AIG CEO Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg.
Morgan Stanley (MS) said it will reduce its staff by 6%, eliminating 1,600 jobs due to current ""market conditions."" While all divisions of the investment banking firm will be impacted, the more senior ranks will suffer a larger collective hit. Once these reductions have been implemented, the MS workforce will be 10% smaller than it was in September 2011.
Plus ... a cryptic invitation from Facebook Inc (FB) has ignited the rumor mills. A media invite to ""Come and see what we're building"" has led to speculation about a FB phone, despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg's assertions to the contrary. Other theories are a new search function or an updated privacy policy. All will be revealed next Tuesday morning at the company's Menlo Park, Calif. campus.

Question of the Day :
Q : What does arbitrage mean?
A : Arbitrage is a trader's attempt to take advantage of minor price differences between markets in order to generate a profit. For example, due to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate, a stock could trade at a slightly different price overseas than it does at home. To create an arbitrage (or ""arb"") opportunity, the trader could buy shares at the lower price, then quickly turn around and sell them at the higher price. Fast-moving markets create a risk for even the most seasoned arbitrage traders, however, as prospects can quickly vanish before both parts of the trade are executed.

2570.0,2023-05-28 00:00:00 UTC,This Airline Just Got Magnificent News. Investors Didn't Notice.,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-airline-just-got-magnificent-news.-investors-didnt-notice.,,,"Last July, Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) agreed to be acquired by JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU). On the day its board of directors approved the deal, Spirit Airlines shares closed above $25. Since then, the stock has been in freefall, recently reaching a new multiyear low below $15.
Spirit Airlines stock trades for less than half of the planned acquisition price. While the federal government wants to block the merger, a recent decision in a separate antitrust case to block JetBlue's partnership with American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) makes it more likely that the Spirit-JetBlue merger will ultimately be approved. Moreover, moderating jet fuel prices bode well for Spirit's stand-alone profitability.
Trading at a deep discount
JetBlue has agreed to buy Spirit Airlines for $33.50 per share in cash, including $2.50 prepaid last year and an additional $0.10 per share (up to $1.80) paid each month until the deal is closed or terminated. The total payment can increase to as much as $34.15 if closing is delayed until next July.
Spirit Airlines stock has consistently traded at a steep discount to the deal price, reflecting the risk that regulators would scuttle the merger. Indeed, as expected, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued to block the transaction in March. The Department of Transportation is also investigating the deal.
Still, the discount has expanded dramatically in recent months. As recently as January, Spirit Airlines stock was trading for around $20. It has lost a quarter of its value since then. This makes the stock look deeply undervalued.
The antitrust case just got a bit easier
Earlier this month, a federal judge sided with the DOJ in its challenge to JetBlue's Northeast Alliance (NEA) with American Airlines. Under that partnership, first announced in July 2020, the two airlines largely operate as a single entity in New York and Boston. They pool their gates and slots, sell tickets for each other's flights, and share revenue on flights to and from those key markets. Unless JetBlue and American successfully appeal the judge's decision, they will have to unwind the alliance in the next few weeks.
JetBlue's partnership with American Airlines was a key point raised by the DOJ in its complaint challenging the JetBlue-Spirit Airlines merger. The DOJ argues that the NEA essentially makes JetBlue a vassal of American Airlines. As such, the NEA and a JetBlue-Spirit merger together would have shielded the largest domestic airline from competition from two of its most significant low-fare rivals.
By contrast, if JetBlue and American walk away from the NEA, JetBlue is likely to resume its prior competitive positioning as a maverick in the U.S. airline industry. While that wouldn't fully address all of the DOJ's concerns, it would give JetBlue and Spirit a good chance of negotiating a settlement with regulators or prevailing at trial.
If the merger ultimately gains approval, Spirit Airlines shareholders would be in line for a $29.85 per share payout next year -- plus $0.10 monthly payments until then. Spirit Airlines stock is currently priced as if the JetBlue deal has no chance of being approved, which seems far too pessimistic.
Image source: Spirit Airlines.
Plenty of upside without a merger
Even if the DOJ succeeds in blocking the JetBlue merger, Spirit Airlines stock is likely to be worth far more than $15 in a few years. Last year, Spirit reported an adjusted loss of $1.74 per share, as strong demand couldn't make up for sky-high fuel prices, rising labor costs, and other inefficiencies.
Fortunately, jet fuel prices have moderated this year. For the current quarter, Spirit expects to pay about $2.60 per gallon on average, down from $3.64 in the prior-year period. That will allow the airline to post a modest profit, even though pilot staffing constraints and a shortage of spare engines are limiting aircraft utilization, thereby driving up non-fuel unit costs.
The engine availability issues are set to dissipate over the next year or so. And while hiring and training enough pilots remains a challenge, Spirit Airlines is on the right track after slowing its growth rate and raising pilot pay by an average of 34%. That should allow Spirit to return to its historical utilization and efficiency levels by next summer. The carrier is also modernizing its fleet, which should noticeably improve fuel efficiency over the next two years, while helping to further reduce non-fuel unit costs.
As a stand-alone company, Spirit is on pace to grow revenue to more than $7 billion by 2025. At a modest 8% adjusted pre-tax margin -- compared to the 11.9% it achieved in 2018 and 2019 -- it would generate earnings per share of roughly $4 by then. That would justify a share price well above today's level, making Spirit Airlines stock look drastically undervalued today.

3066.0,2022-12-16 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines Announces Changes To Loyalty Program,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-announces-changes-to-loyalty-program,,,"(RTTNews) - American Airlines announed changes to its loyalty program, AAdvantage, starting March 2023, with new benefits and rewards before and beyond reaching status.
The carrier has introduced Loyalty Point Rewards, which members earn to unlock further benefits and choose rewards to customize their travel experience.
According to the company, members need loyalty points to achieve status and reset each program year. AAdvantage members earn miles and Loyalty Points when they fly, use an AAdvantage credit card for purchases or engage with more than 1,000 AAdvantage partners. Members can then redeem those miles to elevate their travels and reach status and rewards through Loyalty Points.
Starting in March, AAdvantage members will need to earn 40,000 loyalty points to earn Gold status, which reportedly is available for 30,000 points at present.
With the changes, members will unlock their first Loyalty Point Reward, formerly known as Loyalty Choice Rewards, after earning only 15,000 Loyalty Points and before reaching AAdvantage Gold status. These members will receive the benefit of Group 5 boarding for the membership year and the choice between two Loyalty Point Rewards, such as priority check-in, security and Group 4 boarding for one trip; and five preferred seat coupons.
American said it is removing the previous 75,000 limit on miles that a member could earn on a single ticket. Members earn miles for flights based on the ticket price and AAdvantage status.
The company noted that 75,000 loyalty points are required for Platinum status, 125,000 points for Platinum Pro, and 200,000 points for Executive Platinum status.
Also, on American and eligible partner flights, AAdvantage members will earn two miles per dollar spent on Basic Economy fares for all tickets issued on or after January 1, 2023, for travel starting March 1, 2023.
Vasu Raja, American's Chief Commercial Officer, said, ""We're creating a more meaningful travel rewards program for our AAdvantage members. Only our members will have access to everything American has to offer. Achieving status will unlock an even wider world of unique experiences with the airline and our partners.""

3525.0,2022-05-24 00:00:00 UTC,Can Southwest Airlines Stock Lead A Bull Market Rally?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-southwest-airlines-stock-lead-a-bull-market-rally,,,"The shares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) observed a just 5% decline since April, much lower than the monumental 15% contraction in broader markets. Rising energy costs coupled with skyrocketing inflation have spooked investors in recent times, but strong air travel demand and Southwest’s high operating margins have been key positives for the stock. The company also has a hedge position on almost 60% of the targeted fuel consumption for 2022. While the geopolitical uncertainty due to the Russia-Ukraine war is jeopardizing global economic growth and triggering measures such as new energy security alliances, passenger numbers at TSA checkpoints are a positive indicator for the airline industry. Our interactive dashboard on Southwest Airlines valuation highlights the historical trends in revenues, earnings, valuation multiple, and forecast for FY2022.
How did Southwest perform in 2021 and Q1 2022?
In 2021, Southwest Airlines reported $15.7 billion of total revenues and $2 billion of operating cash assisted by PSP-2 and PSP-3 (payroll support program) proceeds. Rising air travel demand during the latter part of the year pushed the company’s operating metrics to pre-pandemic levels. In H1 2021, the company’s ASMs (available seat miles), occupancy rate, and yield (cents) were 56k, 75.3%, and 12.41, respectively. For the full-year, ASMs (available seat miles), occupancy rate, and yield (cents) reached 132k, 78.5%, and 13.58, respectively. While the demand factors improved during fall and winter, inflationary pressures from the Russia-Ukraine war and supply chain hurdles created macroeconomic headwinds for the airline industry.
In Q1 2022, the company reported $4.7 billion in revenues – just 8.8% lower than Q1 2019. Rising benchmark prices, staffing issues, and the resurgence of coronavirus infections augmented operational challenges. Notably, CASM-Ex (cost per available seat miles excluding fuel expense) surged by 18% when compared to Q1 2019, largely due to inflation in labor rates and incentive pay offered to operations employees. Thus, Southwest booked a net loss of $278 million for the quarter.
Inflation moving in sync with benchmark oil prices
The consumer price index for urban consumers (CPI-U) observed an 8.3% (y-o-y) jump in April 2022, primarily from rising energy costs, which are having ripple effects across the economy. Inflation in key items such as food, energy, other commodities, shelter, medical services, and airline fares was 9.4%, 30.3%, 9.7%, 5.1%, 3.5%, and 33.3%, respectively. Given the 40% increase in benchmark oil prices in the past year, increasing airfares is the only option for airlines to bolster their bottom line. Interestingly, the Brent benchmark is likely to trend downward from $103 in 2022 to $97 in 2023 according to EIA. Similarly, the World Bank expects Brent crude to observe a decline from $100 in 2022 to $92 in 2023 and $80 in 2024 – raising hopes of a return to normalcy as geopolitical tensions ease in various parts of the world.

2704.0,2023-04-13 00:00:00 UTC,South Africa targets $111 bln investment goal in tough investor climate,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/south-africa-targets-%24111-bln-investment-goal-in-tough-investor-climate-0,,,"By Kopano Gumbi and Tannur Anders
JOHANNESBURG, April 13 (Reuters) - South Africa needs to urgently fix energy, transport and security challenges if it is to reverse souring investor sentiment, executives said on Thursday as President Cyril Ramaphosa targets 2 trillion rand ($111 billion) in new investments over the next five years.
Executives were speaking at the South African Investment Conference in Johannesburg, launched by Ramaphosa in 2018 as a way to boost economic activity that had been in decline for over a decade in Africa's most advanced but struggling economy.
Mismanagement and corruption at state-owned companies, including power utility Eskom and freight logistics group Transnet, have had a knock-on effect on ports and road transport, hitting efficiency and dampening investor appetite.
""We are confronted with the consequences of years of underinvestment, mismanagement and corruption in the electricity and rail sectors,"" Ramaphosa told attendees, promising to work
with the private sector to remove investment stumbling blocks.
""As I announced in the State of the Nation address in February, we are now setting a new target to mobilise approximately 2 trillion rand in new investments over another five-year period,” the president said.
Emrie Brown, chief executive of financial services holding company Rand Merchant Bank, told attendees the firm's clients were concerned about the rising cost of production as a result of challenges in the country.
""The way we see it for the future of South Africa, international investment is so important and these challenges make it difficult for us to position the potential of South Africa as an attractive investment destination while there is uncertainty on when reforms will be implemented,"" Brown said.
Anglo American AAL.L CEO Duncan Wanblad said: ""There are a few quick wins that we need to achieve to be able to change and turn that negative investor sentiment around.""
South Africa has experienced its worst power cuts on record, leaving businesses and households in the dark for up to 10 hours daily. The South African Reserve Bank estimates these blackouts have shaved off at least 2 percentage points from growth.
Ramaphosa will be looking to make good on his government's reform promises as he gears up to be elected for a second term as president in next year's national elections.
In his closing remarks on Thursday, Ramaphosa said the 1.2 trillion rand investment target announced in 2018 was exceeded, as pledges reached 1.51 trillion rand.
""The success of this first phase must be a springboard towards a recovered, reconstructed, inclusive new economy,"" he said to a standing ovation from the delegates.

756.0,2022-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,"Dover (DOV) to Acquire Malema, Expand Biopharma Offerings",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dover-dov-to-acquire-malema-expand-biopharma-offerings,,,"Dover Corporation DOV has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Malema Engineering Corporation. It will become part of DOV’s Pumps & Process Solutions segment and enhance its biopharma single-use production offering, which currently includes Quattroflow pumps, CPC connectors, and em-tec flowmeters.
Boca Raton, FL-based Malema is a designer and manufacturer of high-precision, mission-critical flow-measurement and control instruments serving customers in the biopharmaceutical, semiconductor, and industrial sectors. It has facilities in San Jose, CA, Singapore, South Korea, and India. Malema is expected to generate approximately $40-45 million in revenues in 2022.
The deal is valued at $225 million in cash at closing, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, and up to $50 million in contingent consideration dependent on the achievement of certain financial objectives over a two-year period. The deal is expected to close in the ongoing quarter, subject to the satisfaction of necessary approvals.
Malema brings with it a loyal base of blue-chip customers, OEMs and end-users with substantial aftermarket and recurring revenue streams. Malema's first-of-its-kind single-use flow sensor using Coriolis technology offers superior flow-measurement performance and accuracy compared to alternative technologies. It aids in minimizing the scope for measurement error and eliminating the need for calibration in time-sensitive and contamination-intolerant environments.
Dover is working toward building its biopharma platform through proactive capacity additions, new product development, and opportunistic acquisitions of highly-attractive niche component technologies. The bioprocessing industry is full of long-term growth opportunities, courtesy of a robust pipeline of effective novel biologic drugs, biosimilars, protein therapies, non-COVID mRNA vaccines, as well as budding cell & gene therapies. The growing adoption of more efficient single-use production processes will support demand for the company’s offerings of single-use components to end customers. Integrating Malema's technology with Dover’s existing portfolio of single-use pumps for biopharma processing will enhance the accuracy and value proposition of solutions to its customers.
Dover has a long tradition of making successful acquisitions in diverse end markets. Mergers and acquisitions contributed to the top-line growth of $53 million in the first quarter of 2022. Strong demand and robust order and backlog rates supported the top-line growth across the majority of the company’s businesses during the quarter. Total revenues increased 10% year over year to $2,052 million. Dover reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.90, which improved 5% year over year.
Dover expects adjusted EPS between $8.45 and $8.65 for 2022. It expects organic revenue growth of 7-9% for the year. Robust demand and record backlog levels will continue to drive the company’s revenues in the current year.
The company recently acquired certain intellectual property associated with electrically operated refuse collection vehicle bodies from Boivin Evolution Inc. The buyout will expand the technological footprint and product portfolio of Dover’s Environmental Solutions Group business unit within its Engineered Products segment.

4211.0,2021-09-14 00:00:00 UTC,Delta Air Lines Continues Its Run of Outperformance,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/delta-air-lines-continues-its-run-of-outperformance-2021-09-14,,,"Two months ago, most airline executives were extremely bullish about the rest of 2021. A strong rebound in leisure demand led to packed planes and high fares during the summer peak season. Meanwhile, airlines saw growing signs that business travel demand would begin to recover in earnest after Labor Day.
Alas, the summer surge in U.S. COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations undermined this demand recovery. Last week, U.S. airline giants Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) all slashed their Q3 forecasts. However, Delta is set to record an adjusted profit for the quarter anyway, continuing its long run of outperformance.
Delta trims guidance
Two months ago, Delta Air Lines projected that third-quarter revenue would decline 30% to 35% compared with 2019 on 28% to 30% less capacity. This performance implied a low- to mid-single-digit decline in unit revenue from pre-pandemic levels.
Delta did anticipate that adjusted nonfuel unit costs would jump 11% to 14% relative to Q3 2019, largely because of the impact of lower capacity and costs of rebuilding the airline. Nevertheless, this outlook implied that Delta would post a solid quarterly profit, excluding the benefit from the final round of federal payroll support for airlines. For comparison, it posted an adjusted pre-tax loss of $881 million in the second quarter.

On Thursday, Delta Air Lines reduced its quarterly forecast. It now expects revenue to wind up near the low end of its initial guidance range -- down 35% from 2019 -- as the latest wave of the pandemic led to a pause in the business travel recovery. Delta also said it now expects adjusted nonfuel unit costs to rise 15%, largely because of increased labor costs.
On the flip side, the carrier reduced its fuel price estimate by about 6%, more or less offsetting the increase to its nonfuel cost outlook. As a result, Delta remains on track to post an adjusted profit this quarter, albeit with a lower margin than it initially projected.
Deeper cuts at American and United
American Airlines and United Airlines had to make even sharper reductions to their forecasts. American had expected to lose money all along. It initially estimated that revenue would decline 20% from Q3 2019 on a 15% to 20% capacity reduction, while adjusted nonfuel unit costs would rise 8% to 12%. This outlook translated to an adjusted pre-tax margin guidance range of minus-3% to minus-7%.
Now, American expects total revenue to fall 24% to 28% from Q3 2019. That forced it to slash its pre-tax margin forecast by 7 percentage points, to a range of minus-10% to minus-14%.
United Airlines is doing a little better than American. Entering the quarter, it expected unit revenue to grow slightly relative to Q3 2019. That would have enabled it to post an adjusted profit despite a projected 17% jump in adjusted nonfuel unit costs.
Image source: United Airlines.
Now, United estimates that revenue will fall about 33% on a capacity decrease of at least 28%, implying a unit revenue decline of up to 7%. While unit costs may come in slightly better than previously expected, the carrier now expects to post an adjusted pre-tax loss this quarter. United Airlines also walked back its previous projection that it would make money in the fourth quarter.
Delta's industry leadership continues
For several years before the pandemic, Delta Air Lines consistently generated the strongest margins among the three big network airlines. In recent years, United Airlines executives have sounded optimistic about closing that profitability gap. United's initial forecast for the third quarter suggested that it was making progress toward that goal.
Instead, Delta Air Lines' margin premium compared with United Airlines' will probably remain roughly similar to where it stood before the pandemic. Meanwhile, longtime underperformer American Airlines is falling even further behind its rivals.
Delta is well positioned to maintain its superior profitability as the industry recovers from the pandemic. Last year, the company implemented a plan to dramatically simplify its fleet by the end of 2025, while replacing many of its oldest planes with state-of-the-art models such as the Airbus A321neo. This plan should meaningfully reduce Delta's unit costs over the next five years, boosting its earnings to record levels.

2439.0,2023-07-19 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines pilots seek better contract ahead of vote,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-pilots-seek-better-contract-ahead-of-vote,,,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO, July 19 (Reuters) - American Airlines AAL.O and its pilot union have begun negotiations to improve their tentative contract agreement on Tuesday ahead of a crucial vote on the contract, according to a union memo seen by Reuters.
The Texas-based carrier's pilots are due to start voting Monday on a that provides for a pay increase of about 42% and other benefits. But the Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents them, warned ratification was in ""jeopardy"" after United Airlines UAL.O raised the benchmark in its pilots' contract.
""Our respective bargaining teams have committed to working around the clock beginning tonight for the next few days to address crucial improvements,"" APA's head Ed Sicher told the pilots in a memo on Tuesday.
U.S. union employees are piling pressure on their employers for better contracts amid frustration with stagnant pay, high healthcare costs, scanty sick time and uncertain scheduling.
In the memo, Sicher said American Airlines CEO Robert Isom has ""acknowledged that significant improvements must be made"" to the agreement.
A union spokesperson said the talks began on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
American Airlines declined to comment. On Tuesday, the company said it would work with the union to take care of its pilots.
American's union has said United's contract will lead to at least a 2% pay gap between American and United pilots. United's contract also offers better back pay, as well as more days off for junior pilots and sick time, it added.
""Is management serious about doing what's required? Do they understand the need for a genuinely competitive pilot contract?"" Sicher wrote in the memo. ""Time will tell, and it won't take long.""
In a separate memo Tuesday night, American's pilot union instructed its staff to prepare for informational picketing by the close of business on Monday in case talks fail.
Airline unions negotiate their contracts in a so-called pattern bargaining process where a deal at one carrier acts as a benchmark for other agreements.
An industry-wide pilot shortage and a booming travel demand have also handed unions enhanced bargaining power.

2497.0,2023-07-05 00:00:00 UTC,Why American Airlines (AAL) is a Top Momentum Stock for the Long-Term,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-american-airlines-aal-is-a-top-momentum-stock-for-the-long-term,,,"It doesn't matter your age or experience: taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for all investors. Luckily, Zacks Premium offers several different ways to do both.
The popular research service can help you become a smarter, more self-assured investor, giving you access to daily updates of the Zacks Rank and Zacks Industry Rank, the Zacks #1 Rank List, Equity Research reports, and Premium stock screens.
Zacks Premium includes access to the Zacks Style Scores as well.
What are the Zacks Style Scores?
Developed alongside the Zacks Rank, the Zacks Style Scores are a group of complementary indicators that help investors pick stocks with the best chances of beating the market over the next 30 days.
Each stock is given an alphabetic rating of A, B, C, D or F based on their value, growth, and momentum qualities. With this system, an A is better than a B, a B is better than a C, and so on, meaning the better the score, the better chance the stock will outperform.
The Style Scores are broken down into four categories:
Value Score
For value investors, it's all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under their true value before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, and a host of other multiples to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks.
Growth Score
Growth investors, on the other hand, are more concerned with a company's financial strength and health, and its future outlook. The Growth Style Score examines things like projected and historic earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will experience sustainable growth over time.
Momentum Score
Momentum trading is all about taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook, and these investors live by the saying ""the trend is your friend."" The Momentum Style Score can pinpoint good times to build a position in a stock, using factors like one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates.
VGM Score
If you like to use all three kinds of investing, then the VGM Score is for you. It's a combination of all Style Scores, and is an important indicator to use with the Zacks Rank. The VGM Score rates each stock on their shared weighted styles, narrowing down the companies with the most attractive value, best growth forecast, and most promising momentum.
How Style Scores Work with the Zacks Rank
The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions, or changes to a company's earnings expectations, to help investors build a successful portfolio.
Investors can count on the Zacks Rank's success, with #1 (Strong Buy) stocks producing an unmatched +25.41% average annual return since 1988, more than double the S&P 500's performance. But the model rates a large number of stocks, and there are over 200 companies with a Strong Buy rank, plus another 600 with a #2 (Buy) rank, on any given day.
This totals more than 800 top-rated stocks, and it can be overwhelming to try and pick the best stocks for you and your portfolio.
That's where the Style Scores come in.
To have the best chance of big returns, you'll want to always consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 that also have Style Scores of A or B, which will give you the highest probability of success. If you're looking at stocks with a #3 (Hold) rank, it's important they have Scores of A or B as well to ensure as much upside potential as possible.
Since the Scores were created to work together with the Zacks Rank, the direction of a stock's earnings estimate revisions should be a key factor when choosing which stocks to buy.
A stock with a #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) rating, for instance, even one with Scores of A and B, will still have a declining earnings forecast, and a greater chance its share price will fall too.
Thus, the more stocks you own with a #1 or #2 Rank and Scores of A or B, the better.
Stock to Watch: American Airlines (AAL)
American Airlines Group Inc. was formed following the December 2013 merger between AMR (American Airlines' parent group, which was founded in 1934) and U.S. Airways. The merger, which occurred after a bankruptcy filing by American Airlines, resulted in the formation of the largest airline internationally. American Airlines Group is headquartered in Fort Worth, TX.
AAL is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM Score of A.
Momentum investors should take note of this Transportation stock. AAL has a Momentum Style Score of B, and shares are up 21.2% over the past four weeks.
Eight analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.45 to $2.98 per share. AAL boasts an average earnings surprise of 12.9%.
With a solid Zacks Rank and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, AAL should be on investors' short list.

2648.0,2023-04-24 00:00:00 UTC,What's in the Cards for Expeditors (EXPD) in Q1 Earnings?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-in-the-cards-for-expeditors-expd-in-q1-earnings,,,"Expeditors International of Washington EXPD is scheduled to report first-quarter 2023 results on May 2, before market open.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EXPD’s first-quarter 2023 earnings has been revised downward by 10.5% in the past 60 days. However, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having surpassed the consensus estimate in three of the preceding four quarters (missed once). The average beat being 5.7%.
Given this backdrop, lets unearth the reasons which are likely to have influenced Expeditors’ first-quarter 2023 earnings.
Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. Quote
We expect supply-chain woes to have hurt Expeditors’ performance in the quarter under review. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the Airfreight Services, and Ocean Freight and Ocean Services segments is pegged at $971 million and $1.01 billion, indicating declines of 39.3% and 48.7%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter’s reported numbers.
Moreover, airfreight tonnage volume and ocean container volume might have also negatively impacted EXPD’s performance in the quarter to be reported. Our estimate for total revenues indicates a decline of 33.5% year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Customs Brokerage and Other Services’ revenues is pegged at $1.1 billion, indicating a negligible rise from the prior-year-quarter reported number.
Higher capital expenses might have also hurt the bottom line. We expect first-quarter 2023 earnings to decline 34.2% year over year despite EXPD’s cost-cutting initiatives.
What Our Model Says
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Expeditors this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Expeditors has an Earnings ESP of -0.37% and a Zacks Rank #3.
Highlights of Q4
Expeditors' fourth-quarter 2022 earnings of $1.38 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 and dipped 48% year over year. Total revenues of $3,441.52 million lagged the consensus estimate of $4,173.4 million and decreased 36% year over year.
Stocks to Consider
Here we present some stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this season.
American Airlines Group Inc. AAL has an Earnings ESP of +85.71% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. It will release first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 27.

3317.0,2022-08-12 00:00:00 UTC,5 Stocks Worth a Look Following Upgrade by Brokers,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-stocks-worth-a-look-following-upgrade-by-brokers,,,"The ongoing second-quarter 2022 earnings season, which is in its last leg, has turned out to be quite satisfactory despite sore points like supply-chain woes and red-hot inflation posing a challenge. The pretty decent picture so far has been highlighted by the improvement in the top and the bottom lines of the S&P 500 companies (that already reported), which grew 15.3% and 8.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis (data provided by our latest earnings outlook).
While 77.4% companies beat expectations on the revenue front, 68.4% participants outpaced on earnings. Generally, an earnings beat by a company leads to an appreciation in its stock price. Moreover, the fact that inflation in the United States moderated a bit (the consumer price index was up 8.5% year over year in July, down from a 9.1% year-over-year increase in June) brightens the scenario. Against this bullish backdrop, broker-favorite stocks like C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW,Covenant Logistics Group CVLG, ArcBest Corporation ARCB, American Airlines AAL and Bunge Limited BG should be on investors’ watch list.
Why is Broker Advice Important?
Brokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations. Naturally, it is rewarding for investors to adhere to such well-researched information as the same aims to generate maximum returns from their portfolio. The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock.
Of the three types of brokers/analysts (sell-side, buy-side and independent) present in the investment world, sell-side analysts are most common. Various brokerage firms employ them to provide an unbiased opinion to investors after a thorough research. Buy-side analysts are employed by hedge funds, mutual funds, etc., while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors.
To take care of the earnings performance, we designed a screen based on improving broker recommendations and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.
Do Not Ignore the Top Line
However, designing a strategy based solely on the bottom line is unlikely to result in a winning approach. Actually, according to many market watchers, a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings beat. To address the top-line concerns, we included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.
Screening Criteria
# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75 (This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks).
% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10 (This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter).
We have also added the following screening parameters to ensure that the strategy is a winning one:
Price-to-Sales = Bot%10(The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio).
Price greater than 5(as a stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most of the investors).
Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days (Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded).
Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000 (This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 in terms of market capitalization).
Com/ADR/Canadian= Com (This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks).
Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:
C.H. Robinson Worldwide, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), operates as an asset-light logistics player. The improving freight scenario in the United States is aiding this Minnesota-based freight broker. Efforts to control costs also bode well. Measures to reward CHRW's shareholders instill further confidence in the stock.
C.H. Robinson has an encouraging earnings track record. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining one). CHRW has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 14.1% upward over the past 60 days.

American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.

48.0,2023-08-25 00:00:00 UTC,EXCLUSIVE-Danaher in the lead to acquire biomedical equipment vendor Abcam-sources,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-danaher-in-the-lead-to-acquire-biomedical-equipment-vendor-abcam-sources,,,"By David Carnevali
NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Danaher Corp DHR.N is in the lead to acquire Abcam Plc ABCM.O, a provider of supplies to life science researchers with a market value of $5.1 billion, as it expands its biomedical offerings, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Abcam believes that Danaher's all-cash offer is superior to a rival bid from Agilent Technologies Inc A.N, the sources said.
The exact price that Danaher is offering could not be learned. One of the sources said the deal price would be close to Abcam's current valuation, given that its stock has already risen close to 20% after Bloomberg News reported on June 16 that the company was fielding takeover interest.
If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced as early as next week, the sources said, cautioning that no agreement is certain and that the outcome could still change. They asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Abcam, Danaher and Agilent did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Based in Cambridge, England, Abcam supplies antibodies, reagents and other products used in medical research. The company serves roughly 750,000 research scientists at academic, research, government and biopharmaceutical organisations.

2226.0,2023-09-29 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines (AAL) Dips More Than Broader Markets: What You Should Know,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-aal-dips-more-than-broader-markets%3A-what-you-should-know-11,,,"American Airlines (AAL) closed the most recent trading day at $12.81, moving -0.85% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.27%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.47%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.14%.
Prior to today's trading, shares of the world's largest airline had lost 12.29% over the past month. This has lagged the Transportation sector's loss of 4.76% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.86% in that time.
Investors will be hoping for strength from American Airlines as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect American Airlines to post earnings of $0.55 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 20.29%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $13.56 billion, up 0.74% from the year-ago period.
AAL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.88 per share and revenue of $53.09 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +476% and +8.4%, respectively.
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for American Airlines should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.
Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.
Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 9.33% lower within the past month. American Airlines is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.
Valuation is also important, so investors should note that American Airlines has a Forward P/E ratio of 4.48 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 8.07, which means American Airlines is trading at a discount to the group.
Meanwhile, AAL's PEG ratio is currently 0.08. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Transportation - Airline stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 0.32 based on yesterday's closing prices.
The Transportation - Airline industry is part of the Transportation sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 177, putting it in the bottom 30% of all 250+ industries.
The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is down -0.02%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is up +0.42%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is down -0.11%.
Stocks today are mixed this afternoon. Earlier this morning the S&P 500 at a 15-month high, the Dow Jones Industrials at a 7-month high, and the Nasdaq 100 at a 1-1/2 year high.  
Earnings season is upon us. This morning JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings.  
On the negative side was a hawkish comment Thursday night from Fed Governor Waller, who said he sees two more +25 bp rate hikes this year. Also, an increase in inflation expectations pushed bond yields higher and is negative for stocks after the University of Michigan U.S. July inflation expectations indicator unexpectedly rose.
Late Thursday, Fed Governor Waller said, ""I see two more 25 bp interest rate hikes in the target range over the four remaining FOMC meetings this year as necessary to keep inflation moving toward our target.""

Positive inflation news is bullish for stocks after the U.S. Jun import price index ex-petroleum fell -0.3% m/m, a slightly larger decline than expectations of -0.2% m/m.
The markets are discounting the odds at 92% for a +25 bp rate hike at the next FOMC meeting on July 25-26.  The markets are anticipating a peak funds rate of 5.42% by November, which is +34 bp higher than the current effective federal funds rate of 5.08%.

2609.0,2023-05-08 00:00:00 UTC,US STOCKS-Wall St edges lower as bleak earnings overshadow rise in regional banks,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-st-edges-lower-as-bleak-earnings-overshadow-rise-in-regional-banks,,,"By Shreyashi Sanyal and Shristi Achar A
May 8 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were flat on Monday as bleak earnings from companies including Tyson Foods and Catalent clouded a rebound in regional lenders ahead of a key inflation reading this week.
Shares of Catalent Inc CTLT.N tumbled 26.0%, the biggest decliner on the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX index, as the contract drug manufacturer saw lower revenue and core profit in 2023.
Tyson Foods TSN.N dropped 12.3% on posting a surprise second-quarter loss and cutting its full-year revenue forecast, as prices for its beef and pork declined.
On the other end, regional banks' shares stretched gains from a rebound on Friday, with PacWest Bancorp PACW.O jumping 19.9% after the lender sharply cut its quarterly dividend to boost capital.
Peers Western Alliance Bancorp WAL.N and Zions Bancorp ZION.O rose 3.9% and 3.2% respectively. Shares of such banks tumbled for much of last week on worries tied to the collapse of First Republic Bank.
At 9:49 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was down 44.29 points, or 0.13%, at 33,630.09, the S&P 500 .SPX was down 2.81 points, or 0.07%, at 4,133.44 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC was down 29.59 points, or 0.24%, at 12,205.82.
The spotlight will be on the Labor Department's inflation data on Wednesday, which is expected to show the consumer price index (CPI) likely climbed 0.4% in April after gaining 0.1% in March, while excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI likely increased 0.4% last month.
Producer prices, weekly jobless claims and consumer sentiment data are all lined up through the week.
Data points this week will help investors not only gauge whether the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening cycle - including its most recent 25 basis point hike last week - is working towards tamping down inflation but also if fears of stagflation are founded.
""We're in an information vacuum right now, waiting for the next inflation data. And that's why you're seeing some of that uncertainty in the market,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital LLC.
""You had the 'good news is good news' on Friday and a rally knowing no one wants to go short into the weekend. You also have the debt ceiling working in the background, which is a concern for people. Until some of these things get resolved, we are not going to see a repeat of the rally anytime soon.""
President Joe Biden and top lawmakers from Congress are due to meet on Tuesday to resolve the stand-off over the $31.4 trillion U.S. debt ceiling.
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc's BRKb.N Class B shares rose 1.2% after posting a $35.5 billion first-quarter profit, reflecting gains from stocks such as Apple.
American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O rose 4.7% after J.P. Morgan raised its rating to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"".
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.55-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.05-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 31 new highs and 23 new lows.

4663.0,2021-03-02 00:00:00 UTC,"Angola seeks to boost diamond output, negotiating with major players",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/angola-seeks-to-boost-diamond-output-negotiating-with-major-players-2021-03-02,,,"By Sergio Goncalves
LISBON, March 2 (Reuters) - Angola plans to boost diamond mining and open a new large mine in the east, aiming to produce 5.7 million carats there in 2023, or more than half of its total output last year, Mineral Resources and Petroleum minister Diamantino Azevedo said.
In an interview with Reuters, he also said the state-owned diamond company Endiama had been ""instructed to negotiate with the biggest companies in the mining world to invest in the diamond subsector"" in other projects, without specifying.
Asked if Angola was negotiating specifically with diamond majors De Beers Group and Rio Tinto RIO.L to enter its mining sector, he said: ""I confirm ... The latest information we have is that the negotiations are going at a good pace.""
Angola - the world's sixth-largest producer - produced 8 million carats in 2020, 23% below the initial plan and down from 2019's 9.4 million carats due to the global economic meltdown from the COVID-19 pandemic, Azevedo said.
But ""the prospects for 2021 are encouraging"" with two new projects due to start producing in the second quarter, and Angola targeting a total output of 10.1 million carats in 2022.
Despite the ""unfavourable situation due to the lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are working to accelerate the start of production in Luaxe"", he said. The project in the eastern province of Lunda-Sul is close to the Catoca mine, now responsible for 70% of Angola's diamond production.
It will begin pilot production this year.
""We are committed to transforming the Luaxe deposit in 2022 into a structured and organised conventional mine, expecting production of about 5.7 million carats in 2023,"" he said.
With 41% each, Angolan state-owned company Endiama and Russia's Alrosa are the largest shareholders of Sociedade Mineira de Catoca (SMC), owner of the Catoca mine.
SMC owns 50.5% of the Luaxe project, while Endiama and Alrosa each hold another 8%.
""Although Luaxe is in attractive project for any investor, its shareholding structure has already been established,"" Azevedo said, without elaborating further.

2197.0,2023-10-09 00:00:00 UTC,Stocks Recover Early Losses on Dovish Fed Remarks,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stocks-recover-early-losses-on-dovish-fed-remarks,,,"What you need to know…
The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Monday closed up +0.63%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed up +0.59%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up +0.49%.
Stocks on Monday recovered from early losses and posted moderate gains, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 climbing to 2-week highs and the Dow Jones Industrials posting a 1-week high.  Stocks moved higher Monday on dovish Fed comments that signal the Fed may be willing to pause its rate hike cycle, saying the recent jump in long-term bond yields may mean less need for the Fed to tighten monetary policy again.
Stocks initially opened lower Monday morning as geopolitical concerns sparked risk-off sentiment in asset markets after the militant group Hamas attacked Israel over the weekend, leaving more than 1,100 dead.  European government bond yields moved lower as investors flocked to the safety of government debt, although trading in the U.S. Treasury market was closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday.
The attack by Hamas on Israel sent crude oil prices soaring by more than +4% on concern the conflict could widen and threaten crude supplies from the Middle East.  The U.S. sent a group of warships to the eastern Mediterranean.  The Wall Street Journal reported that Iranian security officials helped Hamas plan Saturday’s surprise attack, which raises the risk there may be retaliation measures against Iran. 
On the positive side for stocks, Monday’s surge in crude prices by more than +4% sparked a rally in energy stocks.  Also, the surprise attack by Hamas on Israel over the weekend has fueled gains in defense stocks.
Fed Vice Chair Jefferson said policymakers are ""in a position to proceed carefully in assessing the extent of any additional policy firming that may be necessary,"" as the recent increase in Treasury yields acts as a potential further restraint on the economy.  Vice Chair Jefferson’s comments suggest he favors pausing fed rate hikes. 
Comments on Monday from Dallas Fed President Logan, a known hawk, supported stocks.  Logan believes the recent jump in long-term Treasury yields may mean less need for the Fed to raise interest rates again, saying, ""Higher term premiums result in higher interest rates for the same setting of the fed funds rate, all else equal.  Thus, if premiums rise, they could do some of the work of cooling the economy for us, leaving less need for additional monetary policy tightening.""
The markets are discounting a 12% chance that the FOMC will raise the funds rate by +25 bp at the next FOMC meeting that ends on November 1, and a 28% chance for that +25 bp rate hike at the following meeting that ends on December 13.  The markets are then expecting the FOMC to begin cutting rates in the second half of 2024 in response to an expected slowdown in the U.S. economy.
European bond yields on Monday moved lower.  The 10-year T-note is not trading today, with the U.S. Treasury market closed for the Columbus Day holiday.  The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 2-week low of 2.763% and finished down -11.2 bp at 2.772%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield fell to a 1-week low of 4.472% and finished down -9.7 bp at 4.476%. 
ECB Vice President Guindos said the ECB must stay vigilant on inflation, and interest rates are likely to stay at their current levels for some time ""due to the evolution of oil prices, the depreciation of the euro, and the evolution of unit labor costs.
The Eurozone Oct Sentix investor confidence fell -0.4 to -21.9, a smaller decline than expectations of -24.0.
German Aug industrial production fell -0.2% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.1% m/m.
Overseas stock markets on Monday settled lower.  The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.77%.  China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed down -0.44%.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 today was closed for a holiday.
Today’s stock movers…

Finally, Chevron (CVX) closed up more than +2% to lead gainers in the Dow Jones Industrials.
Zscaler (ZS) closed up more than +3% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 after Barclays upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight.

Kinder Morgan (KMI) closed up more than +2% after Goldman Sachs reinstated coverage of the stock with a buy recommendation and a price target of $20.
Walt Disney (DIS) closed up more than +2% after activist investor Nelon Peltz’s Trian Fund Management increased its Disney holding to more than 30 million shares and is said to be seeking several seats on Disney’s board of directors. 
Airline stocks were under pressure Monday as most international carriers suspended flights to Israel following the surprise attack by Hamas over the weekend.  United Airlines Holdings (UAL) closed down more than -5% to lead losers in the S&P 500.  Also, Delta Air Lines (DAL) closed down by more than -5%, and American Airlines Group (AAL) closed down by more than -4%.

Datadog (DDOG) closed down more than -3% after Bank of America downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.
Fidelity National Information (FIS) closed down more than -2% after Truist Securities cut its price target on the stock to $50 from $60.  
Moderna (MRNA) closed down more than -2% after Bloomberg Intelligence said the company would need a “significant acceleration in inoculations” in Q4 of its Covid vaccines to achieve its guidance range of $6 billion to $8 billion. 
Illumina (ILMN) closed down more than -1% after Bloomberg reported that the European Union vetoed the company’s $7 billion takeover of Grail Inc amid concerns the deal would have hampered competition.
Across the markets…
December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ23) Monday closed up +1-00/32 point, although the cash Treasury market was closed Monday for the Columbus Day holiday.  Dec T-note futures rallied to a 1-week high Monday on the increase in safe-have demand due to geopolitical risks after the surprise attack by Hamas militants on Israel over the weekend.  T-notes extended their gains Monday on dovish comments from Fed Vice Chair Jefferson and Dallas Fed President Logan, who said the recent jump in long-term Treasury yields may mean less need for the Fed to raise interest rates again.  Monday’s +4% surge in crude oil prices raised inflation expectations and was negative for T-notes.

1172.0,2014-04-07 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa's Curtailment Of Brazilian Smelting Capacity Will Reduce Revenues,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoas-curtailment-brazilian-smelting-capacity-will-reduce-revenues-2014-04-07,,,"Alcoa ( AA ) has announced that it will curtail 147,000 metric tonnes of aluminum smelting capacity at its Sao Luis (Alumar) and Pocos de Caldas smelters in Brazil due to rising power costs and falling aluminum prices. These include shutting down 62,000 metric tonnes of smelting capacity at Pocos and 85,000 metric tonnes at Sao Luis.The cuts are expected to be implemented by the end of May 2014.
Alcoa has been periodically shutting down or idling smelting capacity due to challengingglobal marketconditions in primary aluminum. Prices have been falling since May 2011 while costs have been increasing, which has rendered a large chunk of the smelting capacity unprofitable.
Once all the planned shutdown of smelting capacity is complete, Alcoa will have idled about 21% of its total installed capacity.
The shutdown will help Alcoa reach its stated goal of lowering its position on the global aluminum cost curve to the 38th percentile by 2016. While the shutdown will definitely impact revenues, restructuring charges associated with the same will have a further negative impact on net profits for 2014.
See Full Analysis for Alcoa Here
Importance Of Aluminum Prices For Alcoa
Alcoa is organized into four business segments: Alumina, which mines bauxite and processes it into the precursor to aluminum; Primary Metals, which smelts aluminum; Flat-rolled Products, which makes sheets used in beverage cans as well as airplane wings and car parts; and Engineered Products and Solutions, which makes aerospace fasteners, turbine blades and truck wheels. While the Flat-rolled and Engineered Products and Solutions divisions produce value-added products and thus generate higher margins, a significant proportion of Alcoa's revenues still comes from the Alumina and Primary Metals divisions. This makes its earnings highly sensitive to aluminum prices. While the company is trying to reshape its business towards the downstream value-added segments, the structural shift is likely to take time. Till then, its earnings and business strategy will continue to remain sensitive to global aluminum prices.
Unfavorable Aluminum Prices And Reduced Demand
Aluminum prices were on a constant decline in 2013. The price per tonne dropped steadily from $2,100 at the beginning of 2013 to $1,700 towards the end of the year. The situation has been no better in 2014 thus far.
The European debt crisis, slowing Chinese growth and overcapacity in China have contributed to the decline in aluminum demand and its prices over the last few quarters. In addition, the long term expectations for these factors remain largely unchanged, so weakness in prices is expected to persist in the foreseeable future. The only silver lining is that efforts by the Chinese government to reduce overcapacity have resulted in net capacity additions reducing to a trickle. State intervention in the form of subsidies or provision of cheap power encourage smelting capacity addition in China. The country currently has an installed aluminum smelting capacity of around 30 million tonnes out of the global total capacity of 50 million tonnes.
Another factor that might explain falling prices is the persistently high aluminum inventory relative to demand, which may be keeping a lid on London Metal Exchange (LME) prices for aluminum. While LME prices are not the actual realized prices for Alcoa, they do indicate a broader trend in global aluminum prices.
Despite the smelting capacity cuts being implemented, the implications for aluminum prices are not clear. The reason is that prices can be impacted significantly only if across-the-board, large scale cuts take place globally. On a net basis, smelting capacity is still being added in countries in the Middle East where power is cheap and the cost economics works out. Alcoa itself is commissioning its new Ma'aden smelter in Saudi Arabia which will have a smelting capacity of 740,000 tonnes per year.
After The Brazilian Capacity Shutdown
Once the shutdown is complete, Alcoa will have a total idle aluminum smelting capacity of 800,000 tonnes. This represents 21% of its total installed smelting capacity.
Alcoa is expected to make further progress towards its target of lowering its position on the global aluminum production cost curve to 38th percentile by 2016. By the end of 2013, the company had reached 43th percentile which represents an 8 point reduction since 2010.
Alcoa will have to record restructuring charges worth $40-50 million in the first quarter after accounting for tax and non-controlling interest. Of this, approximately 30% will be non-cash. In addition, we expect further charges to be recorded in the second quarter since the shutdown will be completed only in May. The amount for this has not been specified by Alcoa thus far. We expect to obtain this information in the company's first quarter earnings release which is due next month.
We have a Trefis price estimate for Alcoa of $9 .

829.0,2022-03-30 00:00:00 UTC,3 Commodity Stocks to Buy on the Dip,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-commodity-stocks-to-buy-on-the-dip,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Cameco (CCJ) Cameco is cashing in on the surge in uranium prices.
Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) just formed a gorgeous bullish hammer candle at the rising 20-day moving average.
Alcoa (AA) is gunning for $100 per share.
On Tuesday, commodity stocks took a back seat to the rest of the market. But don’t let the short-term bout of weakness fool you. The trend remains higher and inflationary pressures continue to support bullish trades in just about any company in the commodity space. We’ve seen everything from energy to precious metals and industrial metals to agriculture soar higher throughout 2022.
Along the way, there have been a few continuation patterns form like breakouts and retracements. Each has been a gift that paid handsomely. I suspect the current setup will play out likewise. As such, I’m sharing three top commodity stocks to buy on the dip. If I’m being honest, they weren’t hard to find. The energy and basic materials sectors are littered with quality uptrends that just dropped for two to four days.

Cameco (CCJ)

Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) is flying high alongside uranium prices which recently hit their highest prices in over a decade. There are bullish undertones to uranium based on the Russia-Ukraine war and renewed global interest in nuclear energy. But we can make a case for more upside based on the price chart alone.
Since bottoming in late January, CCJ stock has been on a tear. But rather than go straight up, it has taken time to build multiple retracement patterns to give spectators a chance to climb aboard. The rising 20-day moving average has been a gathering ground for dip buyers, and we’re knocking on its door again. I’m particularly encouraged by the steady drumbeat of accumulation over the past two months.
Volume continues to crescendo during up days, confirming big buyers have been wading in. This is not a trend you want to bet against. It’s worth noting, there are other companies with exposure to uranium, but CCJ is arguably the best vehicle given its superior liquidity and available options. The cheap price tag and high implied volatility work well with selling puts.
The Trade: Sell the May $24 naked put for $1.
Freeport-McMoRan (FCX)

Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) takes its cues from the copper chart. And recently, the commodity has been dancing to a bullish beat. I find many similarities between the price action in CCJ and FCX. They’re both cheaper securities with fantastic liquidity and dollar-wide option strikes available. Like Cameco, Freeport has provided several chances to enter on a breakout or pullback to support.
In a weaker market, FCX would have pulled back more than two days before bulls rushed in. But that’s not what’s happening. Tuesday staged a massive intraday reversal. Even though prices closed in the red, they finished 5% off the lows to create a convincing hammer candle, increasing volume to boot.
If you think the march higher continues, consider entering bull call spreads.
The 7 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy in April
Bull Call Spread: Buy the May $50/$55 call spread for $1.75.
Alcoa (AA)

Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is the final favorite for today’s commodity stocks to shop. The bullish narrative for the Pittsburgh-based aluminum behemoth mirrors its predecessors. Inflation and an improving market backdrop have investors willing to chase. Prices are rising above all major moving averages. Tuesday was the third straight down day, but buyers swarmed aggressively at the 20-day moving average.
AA closed at the high of the session after a stunning turnaround across nearly all inflation-sensitive stocks. The psychologically significant round number of $100 is a stone’s throw away and should act as a magnet moving forward. I like building call spreads to prepare and profit for an eventual run to it.
The Trade: Buy the May $90/$100 call vertical spread for $3.70.

654.0,2022-09-22 00:00:00 UTC,Is Trending Stock Alcoa (AA) a Buy Now?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-trending-stock-alcoa-aa-a-buy-now-0,,,"Alcoa (AA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company have returned -27.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -10.2% change. The Zacks Metal Products - Distribution industry, to which Alcoa belongs, has lost 16.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Alcoa is expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share, indicating a change of -78.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -29.5% over the last 30 days.
The consensus earnings estimate of $7.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +4.8%. This estimate has changed -1.4% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.11 indicates a change of -14.7% from what Alcoa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.2%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Alcoa.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Alcoa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.03 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -2.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $13.01 billion and $13.01 billion estimates indicate +7% and 0% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Alcoa reported revenues of $3.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.6%. EPS of $2.67 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.33%. The EPS surprise was +2.69%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Alcoa is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alcoa. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

Top News

Chinese home prices rose 1.1 percent February, or 2.2 percent from a year ago, fueling concerns of a property bubble in China and increasing the likelihood that the PBOC would need to tighten policy. The data marks the seventh monthly increase in the past eight months. Bailout packages for both Ireland and Portugal have had the loan period extended by EU leaders, as they were with Greece, in a sign of good faith as the two countries have taken strong steps in implementing austerity measures.

4053.0,2021-11-04 00:00:00 UTC,U.S. FAA refers 37 unruly airline passengers to FBI for criminal review,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-faa-refers-37-unruly-airline-passengers-to-fbi-for-criminal-review-2021-11-04,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Thursday it has referred more than three dozen unruly passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution amid a sharp rise in onboard incidents this year.
The FAA and Justice Department said they had established an information-sharing protocol for the FAA to refer unruly passenger cases to the FBI for review.
The Justice Department and FBI ""are committed to prioritizing the review of the cases referred by the FAA and initiating criminal prosecution where appropriate,"" the agencies said.
U.S. airlines have reported a record number of disruptive and sometimes violent incidents this year, and the FAA has pledged a ""zero tolerance"" approach. The FAA and Justice Department said the ""increased coordination is part of a broader effort to prevent dangerous unruly passenger incidents.""
An FAA spokesman said the agency has initiated 227 enforcement cases and referred 37 to the FBI for review.
“Let this serve both as a warning and a deterrent: If you disrupt a flight, you risk not just fines from the FAA but federal criminal prosecution as well,” said FAA Administrator Steve Dickson.
On Oct. 8, President Joe Biden said he instructed the Justice Department to ""deal"" with the rising number of violent incidents onboard planes.
FBI Acting Assistant Director Jay Greenberg said the agency is ""working in tandem with our partners to ensure the safety of all passengers and investigate crimes within our jurisdiction aboard commercial flights.""
Through Nov. 1, there have been 5,033 reports of unruly passenger incidents, including 3,642 related to pandemic face covering regulations.
In June, a group representing major U.S. airlines, such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines DAL.N and United Airlines, as well as aviation unions, asked the Justice Department to prosecute violent air passengers.
FAA and Justice Department officials began meeting in August ""to develop an efficient method for referring the most serious unruly-passenger cases for potential criminal prosecution,"" the agencies said, adding that ""resulted in a process where the FAA regularly sends cases to the FBI, which forwards those that merit potential prosecution to field offices for further investigation.""
On Monday, U.S. prosecutors in Colorado charged a 20-year-old California man with assaulting a flight attendant on an Oct. 27 American Airlines flight bound for Santa Ana, California, that forced the plane to land.
Witnesses and court records said a flight attendant was punched in the nose, resulting in bleeding and a concussion. American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker called it ""one of the worst displays of unruly behavior we’ve ever witnessed.""

4479.0,2021-05-11 00:00:00 UTC,Why Airline Stocks Are Under Pressure Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-airline-stocks-are-under-pressure-today-2021-05-11,,,"What happened
Airline stocks fell faster than the broader markets on an ugly day of trading, weighed down by fears that two significant expenses for the industry could soon shoot higher. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) led the way with 5% declines, and shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) were all down 4% or more.
So what
Airline stocks after a miserable 2020 have enjoyed a rebound in 2021, fueled by hope that as the pandemic fades demand for travel will return. There are some initial signs that this will be a busy summer for travel, but on Tuesday airline investors got a reminder that we are still in the early days of a recovery.

Wall Street was in the red on fears that inflation might be creeping in, with a Bank of America report saying that mentions of inflation increased 800% from a year ago on quarterly earnings calls and reports.
Inflation could lead to the Federal Reserve raising rates faster than expected, which would be bad news for airline balance sheets. The U.S. industry raised more than $50 billion last year to survive the pandemic, with much of that total coming in the form of new borrowings. Higher rates could add significantly to interest expense, which could crimp a recovery, or make it harder for the airlines to continue to borrow.
Fuel could also soon be getting more expensive. A cyberattack has caused the temporary shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, which carries about half of the fuel consumed along the U.S. East Coast.
American said Tuesday it was adding a fuel stop to flights between Charlotte and both Honolulu and London to try to make sure they have enough supply. If supply and demand are unbalanced, rising jet fuel prices, even if temporary, could cut into results this quarter.
Now what
The long-term trajectory for airlines is solid and more secure now than it has been for a long time. However, the near term contains a lot of uncertainty, even without these added concerns weighing on investors today. Meanwhile, in some cases, the stocks now trade higher than they did prior to the pandemic.
For those looking to buy in now and ride out the turbulence, Delta and Southwest look like the most attractive long-term options. But given the risks and the likely slow recovery up ahead, it is a good time to be cautious about airline stocks.

3478.0,2022-06-16 00:00:00 UTC,"Airline CEOs, Buttigieg to hold virtual meeting Thursday -sources",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/airline-ceos-buttigieg-to-hold-virtual-meeting-thursday-sources-0,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - Major airline chief executives and other senior leaders will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the busy travel season and recent flight disruptions, sources told Reuters.
Two U.S. senators recently raised concerns about flight delays and cancellations over the Memorial Day holiday weekend.
Buttigieg wants to discuss with regional and large airline leaders ""plans to ensure safe and reliable service this summer, including their plans to ensure this service over"" the July 4 holiday, the sources said.
Travelers are bracing for a difficult summer as airlines expect record demand and are still rebuilding staff after thousands of workers left the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Friday, the U.S. airline industry told Congress the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must ensure the nation's airspace can handle rising air travel demand, according to a letter obtained by Reuters earlier this week.
Trade group Airlines for America said that ""airlines are aggressively pursuing several options to align schedules with workforce availability"" but added ""the FAA must also work to ensure that the air traffic control system is capable of meeting demand.""
Last month, Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey asked A4A, which represents American Airlines AAL.O, Delta Air Lines DAL.N, United Airlines UAL.O and others for answers after more than 2,700 Memorial Day weekend flights were canceled.
The senators said ""while some flight cancellations are unavoidable, the sheer number of delays and cancellations this past weekend raises questions about airline decision-making.""
The FAA declined to comment on whether it will take part in Buttigieg's meeting but in May said it would boost authorized air traffic control staff at its Jacksonville, Florida, center after bad weather and space launches have snarled flights.
The FAA noted that flight operations at many Florida airports have exceeded prepandemic levels and will meet with users of Florida airspace ""throughout the summer.""
The senators separately asked Buttigieg to detail steps his office was ""taking to hold airlines accountable for serious disruptions and to ensure consumers are wholly and justly compensated.
""The flying public deserves the same safety and reliability as before the pandemic, especially since American taxpayers invested $48 billion to keep aviation workers employed so the nation could maintain its high standard of air service,"" USDOT's Annie Petsonk wrote airlines last week in a June 8 email inviting them to a meeting, seen by Reuters.
""The department stands ready to support your work to address these challenges. In May, the FAA began making changes to its air traffic controller staffing to support the increased demand in the country. The agency is also working with airlines to expand the use of underutilized routes, especially in Florida.""

1739.0,2011-07-25 00:00:00 UTC,Presidential Cycles and the Dow Jones: Does it Follow a Predictable Pattern?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/presidential-cycles-and-dow-jones-does-it-follow-predictable-pattern-2011-07-25,,,"(Article by Andrew Dominguez; List compiled by Eben Esterhuizen, CFA)
For generations, curious stock market researchers have sought to make sense of the aggregated behavior of innumerable investors. Is there any rhyme or reason behind anything that occurs in the markets or in life?
That latter question is ultimately unknowable. But mankind has math, computers, lots of data, and a knack for seeing patterns in and between disparate events for the former.
As a result, researchers have found numerous ways of predicting the stock markets, from pure technical analysis of movements to the testosterone levels of traders.
One theory that seemingly comes out of left field is the Presidential Election Cycle Theory. Here is a brief run through of some of the evidence proffered by two recent studies.
Mark Hulbert of MarketWatch compiled Dow Jones data dating back to 1896 and found the following:
- the third year of a presidential cycle significantly outperforms all others, with average stock market gains of 15.5% compared to 8.8% in the first year, 0.4% in the second, and 4.1% in the fourth year; his years begin at the end of September because data is quarterly and elections occur in November
- the market performance in the third year of a presidential cycle is not statistically correlated to the market performance of the previous year; in other words, third years have tended to outperform other years regardless of whether the second year in the cycle experienced a boom or a bust
- he also found that there is no significant correlation between stock valuations and market performances in the third year; “On average, third years perform just as well when price/earnings ratios are high as they do when those ratios are low”
Marshall Nickles of Pepperdine University found similar results in his 2004 study.
- historical stock market cycles dating back to 1942 have lasted an average of 4.02 years, which is essentially the same length as a presidential term; a cycle is defined as the time between peaks or the time it takes to go from a peak to a trough and then back to a peak
- stock markets bottomed out only once during the third year of a presidential cycle in data dating back to the FDR administration. The one time the trough occurred in the third year was in December 1987 (Reagan). The average timeframe for a market trough was 1.87 years into the presidential term. Markets never bottomed out in the fourth year.
But why the third year? And why does it have a 94% probability of finishing higher, as Jonathan Burton of MarketWatch asserts?
Nickles attributes this phenomenon to the well-known link between the state of the economy and the results of an election. “It’s the economy stupid!”
In general, incumbent politicians are more likely to be re-elected and their party remains in power if the economy has been doing well. Basically, satisfied voters have tended to re-elect incumbents.
Knowing this, politicians have tended to (or at the very least they are expected to) use fiscal policy to buoy the economy during the campaign season.

478.0,2023-06-22 00:00:00 UTC,Interesting AA Put And Call Options For August 4th,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interesting-aa-put-and-call-options-for-august-4th-0,,,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the August 4th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new August 4th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $32.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.58. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $32.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $30.42 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $33.21/share today.
Because the $32.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.94% return on the cash commitment, or 41.91% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $32.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $33.21/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $35.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.91% if the stock gets called away at the August 4th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $35.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.52% boost of extra return to the investor, or 38.34% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $33.21) to be 59%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

652.0,2022-09-24 00:00:00 UTC,It's Down 35% But Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) Could Be Riskier Than It Looks,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/its-down-35-but-alcoa-corporation-nyse%3Aaa-could-be-riskier-than-it-looks,,,"Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) shareholders that were waiting for something to happen have been dealt a blow with a 35% share price drop in the last month. Instead of being rewarded, shareholders who have already held through the last twelve months are now sitting on a 27% share price drop.
Since its price has dipped substantially, Alcoa may be sending very bullish signals at the moment with its price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 6.6x, since almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios greater than 14x and even P/E's higher than 27x are not unusual. Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so limited.
Alcoa certainly has been doing a good job lately as it's been growing earnings more than most other companies. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price.
NYSE:AA Price Based on Past Earnings September 24th 2022
Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Alcoa will help you uncover what's on the horizon.
What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The Low P/E?
Alcoa's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very poor growth or even falling earnings, and importantly, perform much worse than the market.
If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 125%. Although, its longer-term performance hasn't been as strong with three-year EPS growth being relatively non-existent overall. Accordingly, shareholders probably wouldn't have been overly satisfied with the unstable medium-term growth rates.
Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 8.4% per annum as estimated by the ten analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be similar to the 9.7% per year growth forecast for the broader market.
With this information, we find it odd that Alcoa is trading at a P/E lower than the market. It may be that most investors are not convinced the company can achieve future growth expectations.
The Final Word
Shares in Alcoa have plummeted and its P/E is now low enough to touch the ground. Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.
We've established that Alcoa currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is in line with the wider market. When we see an average earnings outlook with market-like growth, we assume potential risks are what might be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors seem to think future earnings could see some volatility.
And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Alcoa (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.

1669.0,2012-02-17 00:00:00 UTC,"Stock Market News for February 17, 2012 - Market News",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-news-for-february-17-2012-market-news-2012-02-17,,,"Greek developments receded into the background on Thursday as investors focused on encouraging domestic economic data which lifted the benchmarks to new highs for the year. Following encouraging data from both the jobs and housing market, the Dow rallied to its highest level since May 19, 2008. Moreover, all of the 10 industry groups in the Standard & Poor finished in the green.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) recorded triple-digit gains, surging 123 points or 1% to finish the day at 12,904.08. The Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) jumped 1.1% and closed yesterday's trading session at 1,358.04. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index settled at 2,959.85, rising 1.5% or 44 points. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index slumped, losing 9.1% to finish at 19.22. Consolidated volumes on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, were roughly 7.33 billion shares, marginally than the daily average of 7 billion. On the NYSE, for every single stock that ended in the red, three stocks powered their way into positive territory.
With Thursday's robust gains, the benchmarks are now in the positive zone for the week. There is a day more to go for the week to conclude, and a decent trading session on Friday could help the markets end another week on a positive note. Till yesterday's close of trading, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 0.8%, 1.2%, and 1.9%, respectively, for the week.
Investors have every reason to cheer the benchmarks' upward movement. Since early October last year, the Dow and Nasdaq are up 21% and 14%, respectively. The Nasdaq also recorded its best closing level since December 2000 and is just 40 points away from hitting 3, 000. As for the blue-chip index, it touched its highest point since May 19, 2008. Moreover, the Dow is precisely 95.92 points shy of touching 13, 000. With a few more robust sessions, the Dow will hit 13, 000 very soon and register new multi-year highs.
Only one of the 30 Dow components ended the day on the losing side. It was Kraft Foods Inc. (NYSE: KFT ) that lost 0.1% to end in the negative zone. Stocks like Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA ), American Express Company (NYSE: AXP ), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC ), E.I. du Pont de Nemours (NYSE: DD ), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ ), JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) led the gains among all the other 29 gainers for the Dow and they were up 1.8%, 2.6%, 4.0%, 2.2%, 2.6%, 1.6% and 4.1%, respectively.
Financial stocks were among key winners for the Dow yesterday. Financials were among the best performing stocks and the Financial SPDR Select Sector Fund ( XLF ) surged 1.6%. Citigroup, Inc. (NYSE: C ), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) and UBS AG (NYSE: UBS ) were the other financial stocks that posted gains, and they increased 3.1%, 1.4%, 1.2% and 3.4%, respectively.
Materials was the other sector that clocked up robust gains among the 10 industry groups of the S&P. The Materials Select Sector SPDR ( XLB ) surged 1.8% and stocks such as AK Steel Holding (NYSE: AKS ), Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE ), Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, (NYSE: FCX ), Potash Corporation (NYSE: POT ) gained 2.4%, 2.3%, 3.4% and 2.4%, respectively.
Coming to economic data, both the jobs and housing market had positives to share with the investors. The U.S. Department of Labor reported another drop in initial claims, painting a rosy picture of declining unemployment. The data suggests that the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 348,000, for the week ending February 11, declining 13,000 from the previous week's revised figure of 361,000. Consensus estimates had predicted initial claims to come in at 363,000.
Meanwhile, according to a joint release from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, single-family housing starts in January came in at 508,000, dropping 1.0% from December's revised figure. However, both building permits and housing starts reflected encouraging trends, lifting the broader sentiment. According to the report, privately-owned housing units authorized by building permits in January increased 0.7% from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000. As for the housing starts, the report suggested: ""Privately-owned housing starts in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 699,000. This is 1.5 percent (±16.8%)* above the revised December estimate of 689,000 and is 9.9 percent (±14.2%)* above the January 2011 rate of 636,000"".
Investors chose to focus on domestic data, and largely ignored cross-Atlantic developments. However, the latest from Greece is that the nation hopes to get is bond-swap deal approved early next week. Positive news from the European region meant that financial stocks received a fillip and this development also contributed somewhat towards the broader rally.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.53%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's largest airline would post a loss of $1.51 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.42, delivering a surprise of 5.96%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
American Airlines, which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, posted revenues of $8.9 billion for the quarter ended March 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.01 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
American Airlines shares have added about 8.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -6.4%.
What's Next for American Airlines?
While American Airlines has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for American Airlines: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.87 on $10.98 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and -$3.24 on $43.26 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Transportation - Airline is currently in the bottom 14% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
One other stock from the same industry, JetBlue Airways (JBLU), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2022. The results are expected to be released on April 26.
This airline is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.86 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +41.9%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 118.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.
JetBlue Airways' revenues are expected to be $1.74 billion, up 137.4% from the year-ago quarter.

3903.0,2022-01-03 00:00:00 UTC,Airline Stocks Could Hit Real Turbulence on Jan. 5. Mark Your Calendars.,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/airline-stocks-could-hit-real-turbulence-on-jan.-5.-mark-your-calendars.,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The surging omicron variant was quick to complicate holiday plans when it was first detected just after Thanksgiving 2021. While the U.S. government did not impose any restrictions regarding family or social gatherings during the recent holiday season, many people traveling to such events faced inconvenient challenges. Indeed, airlines quickly began canceling flights and rescheduling others. As it happens, though, the worst catalyst that airline stocks are likely to face in 2022 has nothing to do with the virus. Instead, it has to do with the fifth generation (5G) technology rollout that is rapidly approaching.

Turbulence Ahead for Airline Stocks
In December 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced that a 5G technology rollout was scheduled for Jan. 5 and issued a directive for airlines. The agency noted that the wireless service rollout would mean that airlines should expect potential restrictions for flights landing in 46 of the U.S.’s largest metropolitan areas in the event of poor weather conditions.
As the Wall Street Journal reports, Congress is currently considering proposals from the telecom and aviation industries, prompted by the possibility of 5G systems interfering with aircraft cockpit safety. While the wireless industry behind the rollout has claimed that there is no risk posed to aircraft safety, the FAA has expressed concerns about cockpit safety disruptions. This has prompted the FAA to advise airlines to prepare for disruptions.
Airlines stocks haven’t reacted negatively to the news yet. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) have all been trending in the green today, giving the appearance of companies who aren’t worried about a significant catalyst that could easily send their stocks tumbling. However, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be worried.
Many Unknowns
As of now, much of this story rests on unknown factors. How many disruptions airlines will see, as well as their severity, is largely dependent on the weather. That said, with 46 large airports possibly affected, it seems likely that some fights will be facing poor weather conditions. This is especially true considering this is taking place in January.
What we do know, though, is that Wall Street hates uncertainty. While it’s clear that airlines are shrugging off fears of the variant, that doesn’t mean that these disruptions won’t be felt. We also shouldn’t forget that international travel is still difficult. The State Department recently advised Americans traveling abroad to make contingency plans for the time being.
What to Expect
While these disruptions will certainly be inconvenient for airline stocks, it should be noted that turbulence is temporary. When a plane experiences it, passengers face some discomfort. Ultimately, however, the flight returns to cruising altitude. That’s likely what we’re going to see on Jan. 5.
InvestorPlace contributor Nicolas Chahine recently speculated that AAL was likely to find new investors due to the resurgence in travel. Even if it is only domestic, in the event of no further government restrictions, airline stocks are likely to recover from the 5G disturbances fairly quickly. Investors should fasten their seatbelts but not be alarmed.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) straddled the line between negative and positive territory for the first half of trading, before ending on a positive, if muted, note. The blue-chip index settled with a gain of 12 points, or 0.1%, at 14,712.55. Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ ) led the Dow's 13 advancers, with a gain of 1.9%, while Alcoa ( AA ) brought up the rear, shedding 1.4%. This week, the Dow added 1.1%.
The S&P 500 Index (SPX) , on the other hand, was marginally lower on the day, shedding 2.9 points, or 0.2%, to end the week at 1,582.24. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite (COMP) gave back 10.7 points, or 0.3%, at 3,279.26. Both indexes were solidly higher on a weekly basis; the SPX added 1.7%, while the COMP was up 2.3%.
The CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) inched lower as well, surrendering 0.1%, or less than 0.1 point, to settle at 13.61. On a weekly basis, the VIX dropped 9.1%.
A Trader's Take :
""We finished one of the biggest weeks of the quarter in terms of earnings releases,"" noted Bell. ""There have been a lot of big moves in both directions, but the major theme seems to be a lot of companies beating on earnings but failing to impress on revenue. Underlying sales growth is definitely something we'd like to see improve as we make our way through this earnings season.""

1340.0,2013-07-10 00:00:00 UTC,Is Taper No Longer an Issue for Stocks? - Ahead of Wall Street,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/taper-no-longer-issue-stocks-ahead-wall-street-2013-07-10,,,"Wednesday, July 10, 2013
Stocks are within striking distance of reclaiming the all-time high reached less than two months back, with the pullback resulting concerns that the Fed was getting ready to pare back its QE program. We will get more clarity on the Fed question this afternoon with the release of the minutes of the Fed's June meeting. Also at play in today's session are renewed concerns about China's growth outlook after another weak economic reading - this time about that country's exports.
The stock market's ability to claw back its losses over the last few weeks despite the persistent rise in benchmark treasury yields, is very impressive. My sense is that these gains will prove sustainable only if they reflect investors' collective judgment that an improved economic outlook trumps less Fed QE and somewhat higher interest rates. But if the market's gains reflect the hope that 'Tapering' was not imminent, then we may be at risk of giving all of these back in the coming days.
I continue to believe that U.S. economic outlook was stable enough to allow the Fed to start pulling back from its QE program later this year. A number of Fed officials went out of their way to dial back Bernanke's fairly explicit pronouncements on the 'Taper' question. But the bond market got it right from the get go, pushing 10-year treasury yields by almost 100 basis points since early May. This afternoon's minutes of the June FOMC meeting will likely confirm that Bernanke's comments were more in-line with the emerging majority on the committee.
With respect to China's growth outlook, Alcoa ( AA ) appeared to be reassuringly explicit in its earnings release on Monday, belying concerns raised by a host of weak economic readings in recent days. But today's official export numbers run counter to Alcoa's claims and raise further doubts about that country's picture. The decline in Chinese exports in June, the first in a non-holiday month since late 2009, is likely not a one-off event and likely reflective of some loss of competitiveness for China's export sector. Competitiveness has suffered to some extent relative to lower wage regional countries like Vietnam as a result of rising wages and unfavorable exchange rate movements. The continued economic problems in Europe also remain a headwind, as the more than 8% drop in exports to Europe reconfirm.
The China growth question magnifies similar concerns about the rest of the emerging world as the recent growth downgrade by the IMF shows. The China issue will figure prominently in the Yum Brand' s ( YUM ) earnings release later today as well, though YUM is dealing with a number of company-specific issues that are not directly tied to China's growth outlook.
But the fact remains that a big part of the expected earnings growth in the second half of the 2013 and full year 2014 for the S&P 500 as a whole is contingent on improved economic growth beyond the U.S. borders. For context, keep in mind that consensus earnings expectations are looking for earnings growth to accelerate from the first-half 2013's less than +3% pace to more than +9% rate in the second half and accelerate even further to more than +11% in 2014. With more than 40% of S&P 500 earnings coming from international markets, those growth expectations will likely need to be scaled back.

4529.0,2021-04-22 00:00:00 UTC,Miner Anglo American's first-quarter production up 3%,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/miner-anglo-americans-first-quarter-production-up-3-2021-04-22,,,"Adds detail, background
LONDON, April 22 (Reuters) - Mining group Anglo American's AAL.L first-quarter production rose 3% year on year despite some operations running at 95% capacity because of COVID-19 disruptions, it said on Thursday.
Copper production climbed 9% to 160,000 tonnes in the quarter from 147,000 tonnes in the same period last year, but down from 168,000 tonnes in the previous three months. Diamond output slipped 7% year-on-year, partly due to excessive rainfall in southern Africa and a COVID-19-related shutdown in Canada.
Iron ore production was up 1% at 16.2 million tonnes in the first quarter, while production of platinum group metals rose to 1.02 million ounces from 955,000 in the same period a year ago.
Anglo expects copper output to reach between 640,000 tonnes and 680,000 tonnes this year. It also kept its output targets unchanged for other resources, including iron ore and platinum group metals.
But it cut its guidance for metallurgical coal to between 14 and 16 million tonnes from 18-20 million earlier, as the Moranbah operation in Australia remains suspended.
""The company has maintained its full year 2021 production guidance, except for met coal ... we do not see major earnings changes for consensus earnings on the back of production results,"" Citi analysts said in a note.
The London-listed miner is in the process of spinning off its South African thermal coal business into a new company, as it moves to transition out of assets that mine the most polluting fossil fuel.
""Anglo American's portfolio is increasingly tilted towards future-enabling metals and minerals, with our recently proposed demerger of our thermal coal operations in South Africa moving us further in that direction,"" Chief Executive Mark Cutifani said in the company's production statement.

1502.0,2012-10-11 00:00:00 UTC,5 Warning Signs Of A Stock Market Correction,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-warning-signs-stock-market-correction-2012-10-11,,,"After running up four months straight, the stock market has fallen into a correction. While profit-taking after such a long run should come as no surprise to ETF investors, there are reasons to be cautious about expecting a quick rally.
Here are five warnings that show how the stock market is very weak and could get weaker:
1. High-volume distribution.
SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) shot up to a four-year high of 148.11 on Sept. 14 and then turned tail, closing in the lower half of its intraday range. Since then trading volume on the red days has outweighed volume on the up days. SPY has logged seven distribution days in the past few weeks. This suggests institutions are selling more than buying and buyers' strength is waning.
""The International Monetary Fund caused the market sentiment to dip when it indicated that 'risks for a serious global slowdown are alarmingly high,' in their World Economic Outlook report, which was released in Tokyo on Tuesday ahead of the fund's annual fall meeting,"" said Mark Martiak. He is senior vice president of Premier Financial Advisors in New York with $300 million in assets under management. ""It was its bleakest assessment of global growth prospects since the 2009 recession.""
Lee Munson, chief investment officer at Portfolio LLC in Albuquerque, N.M., recommends traveling to China for bargain shopping.
""China, while ugly beyond belief, is selling at a 20% discount to emerging markets,"" Munson said. ""This is a first. If you want value, and think a hard landing has already been priced in, then China and emerging markets should be the place from now until the end of the year.""
IShares FTSE China 25 Index ( FXI ),SPDR S&P China ( GXC ) andPowerShares Golden Dragon Halter USX China Portfolio ( PGJ ) offer easy access to the People's Republic.
2. Weak earnings outlook.
Earnings -- the biggest drivers of stock prices -- look ugly. Throngs of companies have issued negative pre-earnings announcements owing to slowing demand overseas as the global economy weakens. The negative-to-positive preannouncement ratio for the third quarter is 4.3, the weakest since the third quarter of 2001, according to Pat O'Hare, chief market analyst at Briefing.com.
Third-quarter corporate earnings are expected to drop 2.9% from the year-ago period, marking the first quarterly decline since 2009, according to Thomson Reuters.
""Q2 was an exercise in accounting. Most of S&P 500 missed on revenue and hit on earnings. Accountants earned their keep in Q2,"" said Andrew Norman, an analyst at BullandBearMash.com in Plano, Texas. His firm specializes in analyzing the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq 100 indexes.
""The only thing that will save revenues in Q3 will be channel stuffing. That's where the sales people call their distributors and play 'let's make a deal.'""
""There is too much unsold product to stuff in an already stuffed channel,"" Norman added. ""The auto industry has been stuffing going back to 2010. Channel stuffing is a process, not an event. The issue arises when channels overflow.""
A major Dow industrial component,Alcoa ( AA ), kicked off earnings season Tuesday night on a sour note. Owing to poor demand and low aluminum prices, the aluminum maker lost $143 million, or 13 cents a share, vs. a profit of $172 million, or 15 cents a share, in the year-ago period.
Fellow Dow member,Chevron (CVX) said third-quarter earnings, due out Nov. 2, would be ""substantially lower"" than the prior quarter.
Engine makerCummins (CMI) lowered its 2012 outlook for a second time this year.
3. As goes Apple...
Apple (AAPL) has fallen below its key 50-day moving average and is trading 10% below its 52-week high. It corrected 19% from April to May this year. It fell 15% peak to trough between October and November last year. So it could sink considerably more while staging a normal correction.
The tech giant accounts for nearly 20% ofPowerShares QQQ (QQQ) and 4.4% of SPY. As a major holding in those indexes, Apple could take both indexes down with it.
""The tide may be turning for the stock, at least in the short term,"" said Vahan Janjigian, chief investment officer at Greenwich Wealth Management in Greenwich, Conn. ""But the Apple story is not over. The company makes great products and it will continue to do so.""
Janjigian added: ""However, I believe there has been too much enthusiasm for these products. Whether it is a new iPhone, a smaller iPad, or Apple TV, the stock runs up in anticipation and in reaction to these products.""
""It's normal for investors to take profits on the stock as analysts cut their sales outlook for iPhone 5 sales because of supply problems,"" said Alan Zafran, partner at Luminous Capital in Menlo Park, Calif. He also cited Normura's report of possible slower growth in 2014 but the stock trades at cheap valuations.
""One can hardly call Apple shares expensive, currently trading at 12.5 times forward earnings, whereas shares ofGoogle (GOOG), for instance, trade at 15.3 times forward earnings,"" said Zafran. ""Meanwhile, you have a product wildly in demand, iPhone 5, two other products along the way, iPad mini and iTV, and potential significant growth in China in 2013.""
4. The smart money is short.
The so-called ""smart money,"" or commercial traders in S&P 500, S&P 400 and Nasdaq 100 index futures, are overwhelmingly short the market, or betting it will go down, according to the latest Commitment of Traders reports . Meanwhile, the so-called ""dumb money,"" or noncommercial traders such as retail investors and speculators, is overwhelmingly long. More-knowledgeable commercial traders are more likely to be right than retail traders, who are generally wrong. Of course, that's not always the case.
5. History suggests caution.
October may be the new September. The market didn't sell off in September, so it's due for a correction. Historically, the market dreads September, which has been the worst-performing month of the year for the Dow and S&P 500 since 1950, according to The Stock Trader's Almanac . It's been the worst month for the Nasdaq since 1971 and for the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 since 1979.
""Performance does improve modestly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board,"" the Almanac stated in a client note in August. ""Only the small caps of the Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post a modest 0.4% average gain in the last eight election-year Septembers.""
""Measured on a long-term basis, the stock market typically rallies from it's midyear correction, bottoming out in September or October, and then rallies again into year end,"" said Brian Schreiner of Schreiner Capital Management of Exton, Pa. ""But given all the variables investors are contending with right now, there are a whole range of outcomes with relatively high probabilities in play.""

2063.0,2023-12-08 00:00:00 UTC,Griffon and Clearway Energy have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/griffon-and-clearway-energy-have-been-highlighted-as-zacks-bull-and-bear-of-the-day,,,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – December 8, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Griffon GFF as the Bull of the Day and Clearway Energy CWEN as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.
Bull of the Day:
Griffon’s stock has offered investors the steady growth and value they look for in the portfolio and lands the Bull of the Day after being added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list on Thursday.
The multinational conglomerate and holding company has an expanding presence in the home and building products market along with the consumer and professional products markets.
After hitting 52-week highs of $50 a share this week there could still be plenty of upside for Griffon’s stock with the Average Zacks Price Target of $64.25 a share being 29% above current levels.
Performance Overview
Operating through several subsidiaries including The Ames Companies, Griffon’s stock has popped +39% in 2023 and has now soared over +150% in the last three years to largely outperform the broader indexes.
As one of its most lucrative subsidiaries, The Ames Companies has operations in Massachusetts that date back to 1774 etching its name in American history while becoming a leading North American manufacturer and a global provider of branded tools and products for home storage, organization, and landscaping.
Strengthening Outlook
Extending its impeccable price performance over the last few years was that Griffon was able to beat its fiscal fourth quarter earnings expectations by 22% last month.
Although Griffon’s current fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to dip -7% following a tougher-to-compete-against year, FY25 EPS is projected to rebound and soar 32% to $5.56 per share. More importantly, earnings estimate revisions for both FY24 and FY25 are nicely up over the last 60 days.
This is very compelling considering Griffon’s stock trades at a 12X forward earnings multiple which is a lofty discount to the S&P 500’s 21.2X and its Zacks Diversified Operations Markets' 22.9X with some of the notable names in the space including GM, 3M and Honeywell.
Bottom Line
In addition to sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Griffon’s stock has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for both Value and Growth. Checking many fundamental trading boxes there appears to be more room to run for GFF shares with Griffon offering a respectable 1.21% annual dividend yield as well.
Bear of the Day:
The long-term prospects of alternative energy player Clearway Energy may still be perplexing but unfortunately, there may be more short-term risk ahead landing its stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.
After widely missing earnings expectations for two consecutive quarters investors may want to curb their enthusiasm for Clearway’s luring 6.34% annual dividend yield amid weak renewable resource conditions and lower natural gas prices.
Weak Q3 Results: Notably, the Zacks Alternative Energy-Other Industry is in the bottom 39% of over 250 Zacks industries and Clearway’s Q3 results in November alluded to a tougher operating environment.
While Q3 sales of $371 million topped estimates by 8% earnings of $0.03 a share fell a very concerning -94% below expectations of $0.55 a share. This comes after Q2 earnings of $0.33 a share missed the Zacks Consensus of $0.55 a share by -40% in August.
Weaker Outlook: Largely attributing to Clearway’s strong sell rating, annual earnings estimates for fiscal 2023 are down -10% over the last 60 days while FY24 EPS estimates have fallen -11%.
On top of this, Clearway’s stock is already down -21% this year to vastly underperform the broader indexes and trail its Zacks Subindustry’s -14%.
Takeaway
While it’s far too soon to call Clearway Energy’s stock a value trap, investors may want to think twice before investing in the company at the moment considering its lucrative dividend yield but poor performance of late.

Here's Why Airline Stocks Are Soaring
Wednesday, Dec 6, saw U.S. airline stocks perform exceedingly well on the bourses. Shares of industrial heavyweights like Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines gained 3.54%, 2.67% and 3.38%, respectively, on Dec 6 over Dec 5’s closing. Consequently, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated 2.19% at the close of trading on Dec 6.
All of the above-mentioned companies currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
What Led to the Northward Price Movement?
The catalyst behind the impressive performance on the bourses was the bullish commentary of Delta’s management at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer & Retail Conference. After a record-breaking performance during the Thanksgiving holiday period, management expects another rosy performance in terms of traffic during Christmas, thereby ending the year on a strong note.
We remind investors that more than 5.3 million customers availed of DAL flights between Nov 17 and Nov 26. DAL operated more than 43,000 flights systemwide during this period to meet the buoyant air travel demand witnessed during the Thanksgiving holiday period.
At the investor event, management also sounded optimistic about international air travel in 2024 and stated that its performance with respect to Trans-Atlantic travel had been particularly strong in the current year, leading to a significant increase in capacity to meet the buoyant demand scenario. Management expects the strong Trans-Atlantic performance to continue next year, as advanced bookings remain strong and are anticipated to pick up as we approach March.
Highlighting that air travel demand has held up well over the past few weeks, DAL maintained the fourth-quarter and 2023 outlook that it provided in October with its third-quarter results. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be $1.05-$1.30 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.15 per share.
The adjusted operating margin in the December quarter is expected to be 9-11%. Management projects fourth-quarter total revenues (adjusted) to increase 9-12% on a year-over-year basis. DAL continues to anticipate adjusted earnings of $6.00-$6.25 per share for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.10 per share. For 2023, the adjusted operating margin is expected to be 11.5%. Management projects full-year total revenues (adjusted) to increase 20% on a year-over-year basis.
Airlines Regain Mojo Ahead of Year-End
The record traffic during the Thanksgiving period has provided the much-needed boost to airline stocks after a tough few months due to headwinds like high labor and fuel costs, and a slowdown in domestic air travel demand. We note that airline stocks have been performing well of late and the uptick on Dec 6 was part of that uptrend.
Over the past month, stocks in the Zacks Airline industry have gained 11.5%, handily outperforming the S&P 500’s 3.9% appreciation.
Similar to DAL, American Airlines and United Airlines have attracted huge traffic in the Thanksgiving travel period. AAL flights attracted 6.5 million customers over the Thanksgiving holiday, thereby establishing a record for the airline, with Nov 26 being its busiest day. UAL flights, too, were packed, with a record 3.2 million passengers flying between Nov 17 and Nov 23.
The upbeat air-traffic scenario apart, the decline in oil price from the 2023 highs reached in late September bodes well for airlines. This is because expenses on fuel represent significant input costs for airlines.
Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?
Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year. Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

4827.0,2020-12-31 00:00:00 UTC,Raymond James Places Bet on These 5 Airline Stocks,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/raymond-james-places-bet-on-these-5-airline-stocks-2020-12-31,,,"On Tuesday, December 29, Boeing made history when a Boeing 737 MAX jetliner completed the first commercial flight since all MAXes all around the world were grounded in March 2019. Just after 1 p.m. Eastern, American Airlines Flight 718 out of Miami touched down, safe and sound, at New York's LaGuardia Airport, marking the official return of the 737 MAX to service.
It may also have marked the time investors begin planning for a post-coronavirus revival of air travel.
Against this backdrop, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth released a report predicting that the long-awaited recovery of air travel ""is coming,"" and began placing bets on which airlines will be best positioned to profit from it.
Syth reviewed five airline stocks in detail -- Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), and Air Canada (ACDFE) -- describing how their respective regions of activity, relative strength in domestic versus international air travel, their reliance on revenue from business travel, balance sheet strength, and other factors, make certain airliners more likely winners than others.
So how do these airlines rate?
Well, one airline clearly rates better than any other, and in Syth's view, that airline is Southwest. By adding 12 new airports to its network since the pandemic hit, Southwest, argues the analyst, is best positioned to profit from a revival of domestic leisure and VFR (""visiting friends & relatives"") travel in the U.S., which is the segment of air traffic that she believes will recover first.
With only limited international exposure, Syth doesn't mention that aspect of Southwest's business at all, despite predicting that after domestic leisure and VFR, the international leisure and VFR market will be next to recover. She does note, however, that the third major market to recover -- business travel -- is also a strength for Southwest. Having expanded its network even as its competitors were retrenching, Syth believes Southwest is best-positioned to grab additional market share in the business travel segment.
As for the other airlines reviewed, they're kind of a mixed bag, with each showing different strengths and each plagued by different weaknesses. United Airlines appears to be the analyst's (distant) second favorite airline. The analyst sees United as ranking only fourth-out-of-five in domestic leisure/VFR, which could be a drag on the stock as this is the market segment expected to recover first. That being said, Syth sees United as second only to Southwest in the lucrative market for business travel, with network ""particularly suited to capture the recovery in business demand.""
Syth sees Delta and American Airlines as basically tied for third place, with American having a slight advantage in the leisure/VFR market, but suffering from ""a relative disadvantage in capturing the business demand recovery"" and actually ranking in last place for business. Delta, in contrast, ""is positioned in the middle of the pack"" for leisure/VFR, and ranks fourth in business travel.
Rounding out the list, Syth puts Air Canada in last place, ""worst positioned among the five large airlines analyzed"" for leisure travel because it relies largely on international traffic (specifically, cross-border flights to the U.S.), and only middling in business.
But really, if you want the long and the short of it, you could summarize Syth's report in just five words: ""Buy Southwest; forget the rest."" The analyst backs his Buy rating with a $54 price target, which implies a 16% upside from current levels. (To watch Syth's track record, click here)
Wall Street is broadly in agreement with this analysis. Over the last couple of months, LUV has received 9 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell -- all add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $53.09, LUV has a forward growth potential of ~14%. (See LUV stock analysis on TipRanks)

2119.0,2023-11-06 00:00:00 UTC,US FAA to hold new round of runway-safety meetings after close calls,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-faa-to-hold-new-round-of-runway-safety-meetings-after-close-calls,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Nov 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Monday it would hold runway safety meetings at 16 additional airports in the coming weeks after a series of troubling close-call aviation incidents.
In August, the FAA said it was holding meetings at 90 airports after the National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating seven runway incursion events since January, including some that were potentially catastrophic.
The new meetings with the FAA, airlines, pilots, airport vehicle drivers and others will take place by Dec. 31. They will include Boston, Newark, Washington Reagan and the Dallas-Fort Worth airports, address unique concerns at individual airports and develop plans to mitigate or avoid risks.
On Thursday, a U.S. Senate Commerce subcommittee will hold a hearing on recent incidents that raised questions about FAA air traffic control operations.
The hearing will include FAA Air Traffic Organization head Tim Arel, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy, National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) President Rich Santa, Air Lines Pilots Association President Jason Ambrosi and former FAA administrator Randy Babbitt.
In August, a Southwest Airlines LUV.N Boeing 737 and a Cessna business jet approached within 100 feet (30 meters) of each other at San Diego International Airport after an air traffic controller cleared one plane to land and the other to take off from the same runway.
A similar near-collision occurred in February in Austin, Texas, when a FedEx FDX.N cargo plane approached to land and a Southwest Boeing 737 preparing to take off came within 115 feet (35 meters) of each other in poor visibility conditions.
The FAA said in September it was seeking recommendations on making it compulsory for airports to include cockpit-alerting technologies that could improve runway safety.
It also commissioned a safety review team that is expected to release findings this month.

251.0,2023-02-01 00:00:00 UTC,Alphabet (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings to Benefit From Google Cloud,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabet-googl-q4-earnings-to-benefit-from-google-cloud,,,"Alphabet’s GOOGL fourth-quarter 2022 results, scheduled to be released on Feb 2, are likely to reflect gains from its strengthening cloud service offerings.

The company’s cloud services arm — Google Cloud — has become the key catalyst behind its business growth.

Alphabet’s cloud offerings include Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, which have been continuously gaining momentum in the booming cloud computing market. Google’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI have been major positives.

The Google Cloud segment, which derives revenues from fees collected for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace collaboration tools, has constantly been driving substantial revenue growth for Alphabet.

Revenues from the segment were $6.9 billion in third-quarter 2022. The figure accounted for 9.9% of total revenues and exhibited year-over-year growth of 37.6%.

For fourth-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Cloud’s revenues is pegged at $7.25 billion, suggesting growth of 30.8% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

Factors to Consider
Google Cloud is expected to have continued gaining from the growing trend of hybrid work culture.

Google’s strengthening efforts toward expanding its cloud services portfolio, data centers, availability zones and regions are likely to have helped it gain share in the highly competitive cloud market.

The company’s growing efforts to increase the number of cloud regions and data centers in the Asia-Pacific region are anticipated to have continued to aid its performance in this particular region.

Its robust real-time data, analytics and AI, along with its open and scalable cloud infrastructure, is expected to have helped win customers in the fourth quarter.

Strengthening cybersecurity solution offerings by Google Cloud is likely to have bolstered its clientele in the quarter under review.

In this regard, the company’s Mandiant buyout is expected to have contributed well on the back of its end-to-end security operations suite.

GOOGL’s efforts in integrating data lakes, data warehouses, data governance and advanced machine learning into a single platform are expected to have bolstered its prospects in the data cloud market in the to-be-reported quarter.
 
All these endeavors are likely to have contributed well to the fourth-quarter performance of Google Cloud.

599.0,2022-12-19 00:00:00 UTC,"ANALYSIS-Bumper green aluminium output is good news for carmakers, and climate",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-bumper-green-aluminium-output-is-good-news-for-carmakers-and-climate-0,,,"By Eric Onstad
LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Aluminium makers are set to boost low-carbon metal output by 10% in 2023 and churn out even more in the years ahead, driving down the cost for carmakers seeking climate-friendly supplies and shrinking the industry's hefty carbon footprint.
Aluminium is the most energy-intensive metal to produce, accounting for about 1.1 billion tonnes of global CO2 emissions per year. Next year's forecast increase in ""green aluminium"" output would reduce that by 13 million tonnes, or about 1.2%.
That means global surpluses of green aluminium - largely produced using hydro power or recycled material - already weigh on the premium that producers can charge buyers, from automakers and beverage can firms to construction suppliers.
Vella added that the company had seen some increases in premiums recently, without giving details.
GREEN PRODUCTS
Global supplies of low-carbon aluminium have been robust for several years, but dipped in 2022 mainly due to restrictions in southern provinces in top producer China that rely on hydro power.
Output is due to bounce back globally next year, rising 10% to 18.56 million tonnes - accounting for 26% of total aluminium production, said Simon Large, analyst at consultancy CRU.
In Europe, the proportion of low-carbon products to overall supply is much higher than in the rest of the world, because large Scandinavian producers typically use hydro power, and should reach 83% next year, he added.
AUTO INDUSTRY
The increase in more sustainable supplies has coincided with growing efforts by companies to demonstrate their green credentials to consumers, led by the European car sector.
Germany's BMW BMWG.DE agreed last year to buy aluminium made with solar power from Emirates Global Aluminium, while Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE premium brand Audi is piloting metal from the new ELYSIS technology pioneered by Alcoa AA.N and Rio Tinto, which eliminates all CO2 emissions and replaces them with oxygen.
Most companies are reluctant to disclose how much low-carbon material they buy and any premiums paid for competitive reasons.
Electric vehicle (EV) maker Polestar PSNY.O has started to use green aluminium as part of a project to create a vehicle with zero emissions from every aspect of production, teaming up with Norway's Norsk Hydro NHY.OL, which uses hydro power to produce much of its metal.
Polestar said it pays slightly more for green aluminium, partly due to the administrative costs of changing suppliers, but did not say how much more.
""The cost per reduced kg of CO2 emissions when shifting to green aluminium is still significantly lower than many other ways of reducing raw material emissions,"" a company spokesperson told Reuters.
Norsk Hydro also inked a deal to supply Mercedes-BenzMBGn.DE with aluminium that produces less than 3 tonnes of CO2 emissions per tonne of metal.
HEAVY INVESTMENT, LOW PREMIUMS
Aluminium companies have invested heavily in low-carbon technologies. Norsk Hydro said this year it had spent billions making its aluminium more sustainable, while Rio Tinto, Alcoa and the Canadian government invested $228 million in their new ELYSIS process.
But such investments to step up output are dampening the prices that producers can charge for their low-carbon products, especially this year when overall demand has been hit by recession fears, analysts say.
""Low carbon premiums on the spot side have basically disappeared,"" said Jorge Vazquez at consultancy Harbor Aluminum.
The spot premium for low-carbon billet, a fabricated product often used in construction, has slid to zero from $30 a tonne in January, he said.
Producers, however, are still managing to sell some of their low-carbon output at higher prices under quarterly and annual contracts.
Wire rod commands the highest premiums due to its use in power wiring linked to the green energy transition around the world, he added.
But even the bumper premium for wire rod of $45 a tonne represents less than 2% of the underlying benchmark aluminium price CMAL3.
There are regional variations as well.
""Where we've seen the most willingness to entertain green premiums is Europe, where it is quite accelerated, and we're starting to see the early elements in North America, but Asia is behind,"" said an industry source who declined to be identified.
In Europe, premiums may get a lift from European Union proposals to impose tariffs on imports of high-carbon goods by 2026, another analyst said.
Consumers are benefitting from the plentiful supplies of not only low-carbon primary aluminium, but recycled material, which uses about 95% less energy to make.
Rising output of both will keep green premiums relatively low in the coming years, said Marcelo Azevedo at the McKinsey consultancy.
Limited movement of supplies between regions, however, could lead to deficits in high-demand areas such as Europe, he added.
One area bucking the weak trend is ""ultra-low"" carbon aluminium, meaning metal produced with less than 2 tonnes of carbon emissions per tonne of metals, where premiums are strong due to lack of material, Azevedo said.

3635.0,2022-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,Is WisdomTree Global exU.S. Quality Dividend Growth ETF (DNL) a Strong ETF Right Now?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-wisdomtree-global-exu.s.-quality-dividend-growth-etf-dnl-a-strong-etf-right-now-0,,,"Making its debut on 06/16/2006, smart beta exchange traded fund WisdomTree Global exU.S. Quality Dividend Growth ETF (DNL) provides investors broad exposure to the World ETFs category of the market.
What Are Smart Beta ETFs?
The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.
Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency.
There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.
This kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.
Fund Sponsor & Index
The fund is managed by Wisdomtree, and has been able to amass over $545.85 million, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs. DNL seeks to match the performance of the WisdomTree Global ex-U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Index before fees and expenses.
The WisdomTree Global ex-U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Index is a fundamentally weighted index that measures the performance of dividend paying stocks with growth characteristics in the developed and emerging markets outside of the United States.
Cost & Other Expenses
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.42%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.11%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
Taking into account individual holdings, Anglo American Plc (AAL) accounts for about 7.07% of the fund's total assets, followed by Bhp Group Ltd (BHP) and Novo Nordisk A/s (NOVOB).
DNL's top 10 holdings account for about 45.47% of its total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
So far this year, DNL has lost about -10.95%, and is down about -2.84% in the last one year (as of 04/20/2022). During this past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $36.81 and $43.87.
The fund has a beta of 0.84 and standard deviation of 22.70% for the trailing three-year period, which makes DNL a medium risk choice in this particular space. With about 274 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
WisdomTree Global exU.S. Quality Dividend Growth ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.
IShares Core Dividend Growth ETF (DGRO) tracks Morningstar US Dividend Growth Index and the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) tracks NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index. IShares Core Dividend Growth ETF has $23.74 billion in assets, Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF has $66.45 billion. DGRO has an expense ratio of 0.08% and VIG charges 0.06%.
Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.

WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) - Three U.S. airlines agreed to commit in writing to eliminating family seating fees if adjacent seats are available during booking, the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) said on Monday.
Under pressure from the Biden administration, American AirlinesAAL.O, Alaska AirlinesALK.N and Frontier AirlinesULCC.O will include the guarantee in customer service plans.
""We have been pressing airlines to guarantee family seating without tacking on extra charges, and now we’re seeing some airlines start to make this common-sense change,"" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement on Monday.
USDOT is unveiling a new government dashboard highlighting airline commitments after its four-month review found no airlines previously guaranteed fee-free family seating.
To receive a dashboard green check, airlines must guarantee parents can sit next to children age 13 and younger without being charged additional fees if seats are available at booking and must include that guarantee as part of customer service plans ""so that it is backstopped by USDOT enforcement if they fail to deliver,"" the department said.
Last week, President Joe Biden urged airlines to follow American Airlines in adopting the commitment as part of a broad effort to crack down on what the White House calls ""junk fees.""
""No one should have to pay extra to be seated with their kids,"" Biden said on Twitter.
Airlines for America, which represents large U.S. airlines, says its carriers do not charge for family seating but many do not include commitments in customer service plans. Carriers not honor written commitments can face USDOT enforcement actions.
Alaska Airlines said it has ""always cared for families on our flights and family seating is something we’ve never charged for."" Frontier said in recent months it took steps to ""automatically"" seat young children with an accompanying adult. American said its written plan ""provides additional clarity.""
USDOT has begun drafting regulations to end family seating fees but that could take years to finalize. The administration plans to send Congress proposed legislation in the coming weeks to end the fees.
Biden first urged airlines in his State of the Union last month to take the action, saying, ""Baggage fees are bad enough - airlines can't treat your child like a piece of baggage.""
In August, U.S. airlines made ""significant changes"" to customer service plans with nearly all agreeing to offer passengers meals and overnight stays for delays within their control after USDOT first announced a dashboard comparing customer protections.

2117.0,2023-11-07 00:00:00 UTC,Impala Platinum starts voluntary job cuts at South Africa mines,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/impala-platinum-starts-voluntary-job-cuts-at-south-africa-mines,,,"By Felix Njini
JOHANNESBURG, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Impala Platinum IMPJ.J said it was offering voluntary job cuts to workers at some of the world's deepest platinum mining shafts in South Africa in a bid to cut costs as prices for the metal fall.
The Johannesburg-based platinum miner started the process at its head office last month, and is now extending the exit packages to its sprawling Rustenburg mining complex in North West province, company spokesperson Johan Theron told Reuters.
He declined to say how many jobs the company expects to cut and how much money it plans to save through the process.
""We are obviously doing everything to reduce costs,"" Theron said. ""Labour is a big cost component so you always start with labour by offering voluntary separation packages.""
Platinum prices are down 14% so far this year, with analysts and traders lowering their 2024 forecasts due to weak auto production and concerns about a global economic slowdown, a recent Reuters poll showed.
Platinum and palladium are primarily used by automakers, which embed them in engine exhausts to reduce emissions. Platinum is also used in other industries and for investment. Palladium prices are nearly 40% lower so far this year.
Impala rival Sibanye Stillwater SSWJ.J said last month it plans to cut more than 4,000 jobs and close some of its old platinum mining shafts that are running out of commercially viable ore. Anglo American AAL.L said in October it is weighing job cuts at its head offices in South Africa and across the globe in a bid to save costs.
South African platinum mining shafts are among the world's deepest, oldest and most expensive to operate. Impala's Rustenburg mines are ""scrapping by for now"" and further action could be taken if prices remain low, Theron said.
""The shafts are not making money, but they are not losing money either, they are just getting by,"" Theron said. Impala is also weighing postponing planned spending at some expansion projects at its Zimplats ZIM.AX and Mimosa units in Zimbabwe as well as Two Rivers and Marula mines in South Africa.
""We are in a process to reset the organization for a lower price environment,"" Theron said. ""If all the initiatives don’t take you to a point where you can survive, you have to do more.""

3154.0,2022-10-20 00:00:00 UTC,Brazil mining group sees steady investment regardless of election result,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/brazil-mining-group-sees-steady-investment-regardless-of-election-result,,,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Brazilian miners do not expect changes in the level of investments in the sector regardless of the outcome of the country's fast-approaching presidential runoff, a leader of top industry association Ibram said on Thursday.
Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, is nearing the end of campaigning ahead of a second-round runoff election between leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro. The final vote will take place on Oct. 30.
Lula, who governed from 2003-2010, is slightly ahead in the polls, but the gap has been while many dismiss the surveys outright since nearly all significantly underestimated Bolsonaro's support in the first-round vote earlier this month.
""The two (candidates') stances, even though they are quite different, in one we would have a certain continuity of the current policy... and in the other it would be something that has already been observed,"" said Julio Nery, Ibram's sustainability and regulations director.
Nery stressed he does not foresee major policy deviations on mining from either Lula or Bolsonaro.
""That's why we don't expect there to be a flight of investments due to the election,"" said Nery.
Ibram has previously come out against a potential proposal from Lula that would raise royalties on certain mining projects.
The Ibram association includes major miners like Vale SA VALE3.SA, Anglo American PLC AAL.L and Rio Tinto Ltd RIO.AX.
Mining companies are seen investing about $40 billion in projects in the South American country through 2026, with 10% going to social and environmental projects, according to Ibram data.

530.0,2023-04-06 00:00:00 UTC,May 26th Options Now Available For Alcoa (AA),AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/may-26th-options-now-available-for-alcoa-aa,,,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the May 26th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new May 26th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $37.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.51. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $37.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.49 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $38.53/share today.
Because the $37.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.78% return on the cash commitment, or 49.52% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $37.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $39.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $38.53/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $39.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.27% if the stock gets called away at the May 26th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $39.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $39.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.05% boost of extra return to the investor, or 58.73% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $38.53) to be 65%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2445.0,2023-07-18 00:00:00 UTC,Previewing Airline Earnings: Time to Buy?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/previewing-airline-earnings%3A-time-to-buy,,,"Earnings season shifts into a higher gear this week, with a full slate of companies scheduled to unveil quarterly results. It’ll be a mighty important period, especially following the incredible first half for the market.
And soon, we’ll hear from United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL. United Airlines will report on Wednesday, July 19th, after the market’s close, whereas American Airlines will deliver its results on Thursday, July 20th, before the market’s open.
But how does each stack up heading into their respective release? We can use results from a peer, Delta Air Lines DAL, as a small guide.
Delta Air Lines Q2
DAL’s results beat expectations thanks to continued strength in travel demand, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by 10% and delivering a positive 4% sales surprise. Earnings saw strong year-over-year growth, whereas quarterly revenue reflected a quarterly record.
As we can see below, the company’s top line has recovered nicely from the 2020 shock, with revenues now eclipsing pre-pandemic levels.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Delta was firing on all cylinders throughout Q2; adjusted operating income of $2.5 billion reflected a quarterly record, with an operating margin of 17.1%. In addition, operating cash flow totaled $2.6 billion, whereas free cash flow reached $1.1 billion.
International demand was scorching hot, with international passenger revenue reaching a quarterly record and improving 66% year-over-year on the back of record profitability. And domestic demand also remained strong, with revenues growing 8% from the year-ago period.
As we can see from these results, the company had a record-breaking quarter. To top it off, the company raised its full-year EPS guidance to $6 – $7 and reiterated its previous cash flow guidance of $3 billion.
Analysts have raised their expectations for the upcoming release following the robust results, with the $2.21 per share estimate being revised notably higher over the recent term.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Now, let’s take a closer look at how expectations stack up for UAL and AAL.
United Airlines
Analysts have also become bullish on UAL’s quarter to be released, with the $3.99 per share estimate up roughly 7% since the end of April. The company is forecasted to post big growth, with the estimate reflecting a 180% improvement from the year-ago period.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Our consensus revenue estimate stands at $13.9 billion, 15% higher year-over-year. It’s worth noting that the quarterly estimate has seen zero change over the last several months, with analysts primarily keeping their expectations muted throughout.
American Airlines
Like UAL, analysts have taken their estimates notably higher for the upcoming release over the last several months, with the current $1.58 per share estimate up 27%. The quarterly estimate implies an improvement of roughly 105% year-over-year.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company is expected to post modest revenue growth, with the $13.7 billion consensus estimate reflecting 2% higher sales. In addition, the quarterly estimate has been modestly revised downward by 1% since the end of April.
Bottom Line
With earnings season shifting into a higher gear this week, investors will have plenty of quarterly prints to remain busy with for some time.
We’ve already heard from Delta Air Lines DAL, with the company breaking multiple records and posting robust results on the back of continued strength in travel demand.
And soon, we’ll hear from United Airlines UAL and American Airlines AAL. Analysts have been bullish for both companies’ quarters to be reported, with positive earnings estimate revisions hitting the tape.
In addition, both companies currently have a positive Earnings ESP Score heading into their prints.

After declining 11.5% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.
How to Determine if a Stock is Oversold
We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.
RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.
Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.
So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefitting from the inevitable rebound.
However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.
Why a Trend Reversal is Due for A
The heavy selling of A shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 25. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.
This technical indicator is not the only factor that calls for a potential rebound for the stock. There is a fundamental indicator as well. A strong agreement among sell-side analysts covering An in raising earnings estimates for the current year has led to an increase in the consensus EPS estimate by 0.6% over the last 30 days. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.
Moreover, A currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

3515.0,2022-06-01 00:00:00 UTC,Why Airline Stocks Are Losing Altitude Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-airline-stocks-are-losing-altitude-today,,,"What happened
Airline stocks started Wednesday on an up note, fueled by positive commentary from Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL). But a grim forecast from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon gave rise to fresh recession fears, causing shares of Delta, American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) to all trade down 5% or more.
So what
As we've noted before, airline stocks are stuck in a holding pattern right now. Strong demand and pricing power is leading to higher-than-expected revenue growth throughout the industry, but that is being offset by higher costs. And with significant uncertainty surrounding issues ranging from a new COVID wave to a falloff in consumer demand, the stocks have had trouble climbing higher.
Image source: Delta Air Lines.
Delta got the trading day off to a positive start, releasing updated guidance that called for stronger revenue and operating margins than initially expected. Total revenue is expected to be 7% to 8% better than initially expected, and a forecasted operating margin of 13% to 14% would be at the high end of the initial guidance despite fuel prices that are up more than 70% from 2019.
Investors are well aware of the cost issues, but Delta's apparent ability to pass those costs on to consumers in the form of higher ticket prices is a positive sign. As a result, Delta initially traded up 1.8% on Wednesday morning, with other airline stocks following its lead.
The rally turned south along with the broader market after Dimon, speaking at an investor conference, said the U.S. economy faces a ""hurricane"" as the Federal Reserve attempts to battle rising inflation. Dimon is one of the most respected CEOs on Wall Street, and his bank's massive size and exposure to different markets give him a good view of how the economy is shifting.
The health of the economy is weighing on airline investors because airline tickets, by and large, are a discretionary spending item. If consumers are feeling the pinch of inflation, or worried about the direction that the economy is heading, it could cause them to postpone travel plans. Delta and other airlines have made it clear that the second quarter will come in strong, but many of those tickets were bought months ago. It is far less certain how sustainable this strong demand is, or what will happen to airlines once the summer vacation season ends.
Now what
There were other glimmers of hope out of Delta that should not be ignored. CEO Ed Bastian said during a presentation at an investor conference that corporate travel remains depressed in part because business flyers right now must ""fight to get back on the airplane,"" a comment on just how strong leisure demand is right now. The implication is there are no seats left for last-minute business travel.
Business travel has been sluggish since the onset of the pandemic, and a recovery in corporate travel would go a long way toward filling the seats when the summer ends. Of course, those economic factors that Dimon mentioned could put a lid on business travel as well, but airline investors will be happy to know that demand for business tickets is on the upswing.
The issue, as it has been for a while, is that this recovery will take time. And with so much uncertainty about the economy and the pandemic, there is probably more risk to the downside than potential for a dramatic rise in the months to come.
Delta's update is a reminder that it is a well-run airline that seems likely to recover before some of the competition, but in this macro environment there is only so much any individual company can do. Thursday's trading action is a reminder to investors how much airline stocks right now are tied to conditions beyond their control.

342.0,2022-11-18 00:00:00 UTC,5 Stocks With Recent Dividend Hike for a Stable Portfolio,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-stocks-with-recent-dividend-hike-for-a-stable-portfolio-0,,,"U.S. stock markets have been witnessing an impressive rally since the beginning of October. Recently released several data have clearly shown that inflation is dwindling, albeit at a slow pace. A large section of market participants believes that as peak inflation is likely behind us, the Fed will relax its tighter monetary control.
However, we are not out of the woods as inflation remains elevated. On Nov 17, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said that the Fed needs to keep raising rates because policy tightening has so far had only limited effects on observed inflation. The target policy needs to rise to at least 5.00% to 5.25% from the current level of just below 4.00% to be sufficiently restrictive.
Bullard’s comment is being perceived as a pushback from the Fed’s recent stance of trying to reassure the markets that it would slacken its stringent policy measures to avoid a hard-landing of the economy. Investors are concerned that a higher interest rate will lead to a recession in 2023.
Stocks in Focus
At this stage, dividend-paying stocks should be in demand as investors will try to safeguard their portfolio. We believe that one should consider stocks that have recently raised their dividend payments. Five such companies are Agilent Technologies Inc. A, KeyCorp KEY, Griffon Corp. GFF, Group 1 Automotive Inc. GPI and Suncor Energy Inc. SU.
Agilent is benefiting from continued strong growth in the pharmaceutical market. Solid momentum across the Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) and the Agilent Cross Lab Group (ACG) segments is contributing well to top-line growth.
We expect LSAG and ACG revenues to grow respectively 7.2% and 8.2% year over year in fiscal 2022. Growth in Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry instruments, Consumables and Chemistries, and Cell Analysis platforms remains a tailwind. Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

MONTREAL, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Airlines are reopening airport lounges with higher-end service to lure back premium travelers after the pandemic, while increasingly opening the VIP experience to tourists - for a fee.
Premium travel plummeted during the COVID-19 crisis, depriving airlines of higher-margin fares. But with traffic rebounding in certain regions and U.S.-bound travel set to reopen on Nov 8, lounges are a crucial weapon in airlines' post-crisis strategies for retaining their more profitable clients.
United Airlines UAL.O opened its first Polaris lounge at Washington Dulles on Oct 21 and announced plans last Thursday to reopen existing lounges in New York, Chicago and Houston by end-year, with the rest set to follow in early 2022.
Air France AIRF.PA has inaugurated a 3,000-square-metre temple to French design in one of its main terminals at Paris Charles de Gaulle. Dubai's Emirates EMIRA.UL and Air Canada AC.TO both plan upgrades to lounge dining and service.
""A lot of the narrative around 2022 is really going to be around that food program, how we serve our customers and elevating that aspect of the experience,"" said Mats Winter, director of product for Canada's largest carrier.
Air Canada wants a ""competitive product"" for its business clientele but also for leisure travelers who are making up a growing part of premium-fare purchases, he said.
""The mix has changed, but our commitment to making sure we have a great premium product hasn't. We are obviously keeping a very close eye on the traffic we are seeing in our lounges,"" Winter added.
NEW REVENUES
Designed as an oasis for premium travelers, lounges could attract more passengers looking to avoid crowds during COVID, said Michael Di Corpo, managing director of Montreal-based firm IEG, which sells software for managing airport lounges.
Passengers globally are contending with longer lines due to requirements like proof of vaccination, while many face longer layovers since ailing airlines now offer fewer direct flights.
""We're seeing more of the 'paying their way' as a way of generating revenues, assuming they're not at capacity,"" Di Corpo said, referring to the purchase of daily lounge access.
Airlines contacted by Reuters don't break out revenues from lounge services.
While some airlines have previously sold lounge access to passengers from the back of the plane, pressure to find new revenues in the wake of the industry's worst crisis has grown.
Qatar Airways for one, recently launched a less expensive Business Lite fare, where lounge access costs extra.
American Airlines AAL.O, which reopened the first of its Flagship Lounges in September to premium classes on long-haul flights, made paid access available for the first time.
The airline is especially targeting people traveling for occasions like weddings and reunions, a spokeswoman said.
But there are limits to the democratization of lounges, which can represent investments of millions of dollars.
The last thing executives say they can afford is to crowd out corporate clientele or well-off individuals who drive profits on routes like the Atlantic, with the U.S. lifting restrictions Nov 8 for vaccinated foreigners.
At American, the $150 cost of a day pass to Flagship doesn't give economy passengers access to its most elite service, a private restaurant within the lounge. It does include food with a different menu and space.
United said Polaris lounges would remain premium class only.
Air Canada decided last November to open three of its Maple Leaf lounges to paying walk-in economy passengers and travelers from other airlines on a trial basis to use spare capacity during COVID-19. It has since ended the practice in Vancouver.
""We don't want this to eventually drive capacity concerns, for example, for our premium customers,"" Winter said.

1128.0,2020-08-12 00:00:00 UTC,Aluminium sector struggles to adopt common standards to cut emissions,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aluminium-sector-struggles-to-adopt-common-standards-to-cut-emissions-2020-08-12,,,"By Eric Onstad
LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The aluminium industry, one of the metals sector's largest emitters of greenhouse gas, is struggling to adopt common standards on greener processing as rivals focus on promoting their own products rather than the wider green market.
Multiple initiatives are seeking to set low-carbon benchmarks as rivals fight for market share in a sector burdened by big surpluses.
Aluminium, which requires huge amounts of power to smelt, is one of the most carbon-intensive metals, emitting an average of 16.5 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of production. In contrast steel processing, while a much bigger polluter overall, emits just 2.3 tonnes per tonne.
Most large aluminium groups have launched products with lower-carbon footprints, mostly using hydro power, but each uses different standards.
UK-based consultancy the Carbon Trust proposed in June a set of guidelines for labelling aluminium as low-carbon if its production emits 4 tonnes or less of CO2 per tonne of metal, about 20% of global output.
However the proposals have stalled, partly because the research was funded by Russia's EN+ ENPLq.L, which owns aluminium giant Rusal 0486.HK. Other producers are reluctant to adopt proposals funded by a rival.
""There's the suggestion that it is being used as part of a campaign to create a benchmark for their products,"" an industry source said.
The Carbon Trust said that while the report was funded with support from EN+, the contents are its own independent views.
Elsewhere the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative certifies operations as sustainable using criteria including transparency regarding greenhouse gases.
U.S.-based consultancy Harbor Aluminum, which last October launched an green aluminium premium assessment, plans to launch an informal consultation on standard labelling, its managing director told Reuters.
But Harbor's premium has been stuck at zero since it was launched, he added, as buyers baulk at paying extra for greener material despite pressure to address emissions throughout their supply chains.

2796.0,2023-03-21 00:00:00 UTC,Why You Should Retain Canadian National (CNI) Stock Now,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-you-should-retain-canadian-national-cni-stock-now,,,"Canadian National Railway Company (CNI) is benefiting from the impressive freight demand scenario and the solid pricing environment. However, low liquidity is a concern.
Factors Favoring CNI
Impressive freight demand and favorable pricing environment are driving Canadian National’s growth. Freight revenues (C$4,400 million), which contributed 96.8% to the top line, increased 23% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022. Freight revenues at the Petroleum and Chemicals, Metals and minerals, Forest products, Coal, Grain and fertilizers, Intermodal and Automotive segments increased 5%, 27%, 19%, 42%, 48%, 13% and 48%, respectively.
Despite the softening of the overall demand scenario, management expects adjusted earnings per share to increase in low-single-digit percentage year over year in the current year.
Key Risk
Canadian National’s liquidity position is a matter of concern. CNI's current ratio at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 was 0.84. A current ratio of less than 1 implies that the company doesn't have enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities.
Zacks Rank & Key Picks
Canadian National currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation sector are American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
American Airlines is also being aided by the improved air travel demand situation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, AAL reported earnings of $1.17 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.63%. For first-quarter 2023, AAL’s earnings are expected to register 100.4% growth on a year-over-year basis. For 2023, the company’s earnings are expected to grow 332% on a year-over-year basis.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s full-year 2023 earnings are expected to surge 332% year over year.
United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand. On the back of upbeat air-travel demand, UAL was profitable in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter was the third consecutive profitable quarter at UAL.
Driven by solid demand, management expects total revenue per available seat mile to grow 25% year over year for the first quarter of 2023. Total revenues are anticipated to grow 50% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UAL’s full-year 2023 earnings are expected to surge 227% year over year.

3138.0,2022-10-28 00:00:00 UTC,How Much Upside is Left in American Airlines (AAL)? Wall Street Analysts Think 29%,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-much-upside-is-left-in-american-airlines-aal-wall-street-analysts-think-29,,,"Shares of American Airlines (AAL) have gained 14% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $13.97, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $18 indicates a potential upside of 28.9%.
The average comprises 12 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $8 to a high of $28, with a standard deviation of $6.76. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 42.7% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 100.4% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.
While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.
However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in AAL. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.
Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Here's What You Should Know About Analysts' Price Targets
According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.
While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?
They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.
However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.
That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.
Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in AAL
Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current year, seven estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days compared to no negative revision. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 63.7%.
Moreover, AAL currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>
Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much AAL could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Airline Stocks Roundup: American, Allegiant & More
In the past week, American Airlines received encouraging tidings on the labor front when the company's pilots, represented by Allied Pilots Association or APA, approved a four-year deal pertaining to wage increase. Due to the pay increase, management expects labor costs to increase in third-quarter 2023.
Meanwhile, Allegiant Travel's traffic report for the month of July was impressive owing to the post-pandemic surge in air-travel demand. Driven by high passenger volumes, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) in July inched up 0.7 points to 91.2% from the year-ago quarter.
Read the last Airline Roundup here.
Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories
1. The approval of the tentative agreement makes AAL's pilots eligible for an immediate pay raise in excess of 21% on average. Also, the deal includes provisions aimed at improving pilots' quality of life. The approval implies that company contributions to retirement plans will increase. The contract becomes amendable on Aug 1, 2027 and includes a provision that the next round of bargaining can begin as soon as November 2026. The four-year contract boosts the overall compensation of AAL pilots by more than 46% over its duration and is valued at $9.6 billion.
The deal has provisions for retroactive pay for the first four months of 2023. This implies that $230 million will get reflected as additional expenses in the September-quarter results. Including the expenditures associated with the deal, American Airlines now expects third-quarter cost per available seat mile excluding fuel and net special items or CASM-ex to rise in the 4-6% band on a year-over-year basis (prior guidance: 2-4% year-over-year jump).
2. In July, scheduled traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) at ALGT was flat compared with July 2022 levels. Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for scheduled service also decreased marginally from the July 2022 reading. For the total system (including scheduled service and fixed fee contract), Allegiant carried more passengers in July 2023 from the year-ago period's level. Total departures (scheduled services) increased 3.2% in July 2023 from its year-ago levels. Fuel price per gallon in July is estimated to have been $2.77 compared with $2.64 in June.
3. JetBlue Airways reportedly aims to hike fares on Spirit Airlines' flights by as much as 40% if the $3.8 billion deal materializes. JBLU intends to do away with 24 seats on an average from each of SAVE's roughly 200 planes to reduce capacity and increase prices. The disclosure may jeopardize the chances of the deal, which was announced in July 2022, going through. The Justice Department is already challenging the deal with a trial expected to commence in October.
Currently, JBLU carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Price Performance

( AA ) shares are trading down nearly 2 percent ahead of the company's first-quarter 2012 report, generally regarded as the unofficial kickoff to earnings season. The figures are expected out after the market closes Tuesday.
The Street is looking for Alcoa to produce a loss of 4 cents per share on revenue of $5.77 billion. During the same quarter last year, Alcoa reported earnings of 28 cents per share and revenue of $5.96 billion. Over the last six quarters, Alcoa has managed to miss Street expectations by an average of 21 percent, tipped off with its second-quarter report last year.
In April, Alcoa said it was cutting alumina production by 390,000 metric tons, allowing production to come more in-line with smelter curtailments.
Through the quarter, Alcoa shares gained 16.2 percent to $10.02 at the end of March. This is a nice pop after Alcoa finished 43 percent lower in 2011. Over the last 52-week time frame, Alcoa shares have traded within a range of $8.45 to $18.19.
Analysts are fairly even on the prospects for Alcoa over the next year, with eight having a Buy rating, 10 at Hold, and three with a Sell-equivalent call on the stock. The analyst price target average is $11.75, ranging from $8 to $18.
Analyst Comments
Goldman Sachs sees a loss of 3 cents per share, which is ahead of the market. The firm is focusing its attention on the slowdown in Europe, where Alcoa derives about 20 percent of its total top-line results. Goldman sees uncertainty and slow demand in Europe as well as low aluminum prices more than offsetting any positive sentiment with Alcoa's position in the aerospace industry as well as aluminum-alumina price decoupling.
The firm has a Neutral rating and $11 target on the shares.
Deutsche Bank sees Alcoa issuing a loss of 5 cents per share in the quarter. Earnings will be negatively impacted by $30 million in raw material and maintenance expenses in alumina, $10 million in foreign exchange, and $25 million in energy-related costs in Primary metals.
The firm commented: ""At 1Q12E EBITDA rates and without a significant recovery in aluminum prices, we believe Alcoa may resort to ~6% equity issuance in 2012 to fund a $650m pension gap, otherwise leverage will rise."" Aluminum pricing in the quarter should come in at $1.12 per pound, which is a one cent increase in the benchmark LME price more than offset by weaker permia of 14 cents per pound.
Deutsche expects Alcoa to provide an update on recent capacity cuts: ""While 90k ton cut in Spanish smelters scheduled by 1H12, Union pressure has post-poned 150k ton Italian smelter cuts until end-2012. In addition, Alcoa has put its 190k tons Point Henry (Australia) smelter under review on rising costs/ strong AUD.""

1780.0,2011-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa on Track for a Bumper Year,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-track-bumper-year-2011-04-20,,,"Alcoa ( AA ) recently announced its performance for the first quarter of 2011. Based on these figures, we have updated our price estimate to $17 from the earlier value of $17.68. While the increase in aluminium prices and divisional shipment figures have been close to the values we initially estimated, we revised our price estimate due to the significant reduction in the cash & cash equivalents held by the company. The company competes with other international metals and mining giants like Rusal, Rio Tinto ( RIO ), BHP Billiton ( BHP ) and Chalco ( ACH ).
Results at a Glance
The fact that the aluminium industry has recovered from the economic downturn and now faces rising demand came through in Alcoa's Q1'11 earnings. The company reported almost $6 billion in sales for the quarter, more than 20% higher year-over-year (yoy). While this is just a 7% increase over the previous quarter (Q4 2010), the net income increased by almost 20% - crossing $300 million sequentially.
The primary metals division continued to be the biggest source of income for the company bringing in revenues in excess of $2.8 billion, and an after-tax operating income (ATOI) of more than $200 million.
Also, the decrease in cash balances for the quarter can be explained by the investments by Alcoa in Ma'aden and Electronics Recyclers International, the acquisition of TransDigm, and the increase in its working capital.
Might be Most Profitable Year Yet
The increasing demand for aluminium in packaging, automotive, commercial transportation and industrial products has been helping aluminium prices while driving shipment numbers. We wrote recently on the packaging industry's use of aluminium in a note titled Good Things Come in Aluminum Packages for Alcoa . Increasing copper prices have also helped aluminium step in as a substitute, and for Alcoa in particular. We discussed this our article titled Rising Copper Prices are Good News for Aluminum Producer Alcoa . In late 2010, Alcoa predicted a 12% growth in the global demand for aluminium in the year 2011, and it has reaffirmed this as a part of its earnings release. This would help support higher prices through the year. We believe that the primary metals division would continue to drive value for Alcoa - with the company's decision to restart operations at its Massena, Intalco and Wenatchee plants help this outlook.

296.0,2023-01-05 00:00:00 UTC,Garmin (GRMN) Boosts Automotive Offerings With Dash Cam Live,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/garmin-grmn-boosts-automotive-offerings-with-dash-cam-live,,,"Garmin GRMN introduced an always-connected LTE dash cam — Dash Cam Live, in a bid to bolster its automotive segment.

Dash Cam Live, which marks the company’s first LTE-connected dash cam, records high-definition 1440p video with a 140-degree field of view and offers access to a live exterior view of the vehicle.

Growing Portfolio of Automotive Solutions
The latest move bodes well for the company’s strong efforts toward expanding its portfolio of automotive solutions.

Apart from the latest launch, the company unveiled tablet-like 8 and 10-inch RV 895 and RV 1095 navigators, which feature large display, and provide custom vehicle routing and preloaded traveler content in order to deliver an enhanced camping experience.

Garmin’s introduction of the dezlCam OTR710, featuring a high-definition dash cam to provide a safe-driving experience to drivers, is another positive.

It also launched the dezl OTR series of trucking navigators, featuring arrival planning with automatic birds-eye satellite imagery for high-resolution aerial views during truck entries at the security gates and while loading at dock destinations.

The continuous launch of automotive solutions is expected to help Garmin bolster its presence in the growing automotive market.

This, in turn, is likely to aid GRMN in raising investors' optimism about the stock in the days ahead.

Notably, shares of GRMN have been down 28% over a year.
Customer Base to Expand
We believe that expanding the automotive solutions portfolio will continue to strengthen its customer base.

Recently, Palomino RV selected the Garmin ONE (Operation, Navigation, Entertainment) solution to boost its Pause line of travel trailers. With the Garmin ONE technology, Palomino aims to provide camping trailer users with seamless control of camper systems, navigation and entertainment.

Arctic Cat also chose Garmin’s Tread navigators to outfit the new Wildcat XX Black Hills Edition side-by-side vehicles for technical trail riding, difficult climbs and rock crawling.

We note that the strengthening clientele will continue to drive GRMN’s automotive segment revenues in the days ahead.

The automotive segment generated $135.6 million in sales, accounting for 12% of the total third-quarter 2022 revenues.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

3829.0,2022-01-27 00:00:00 UTC,"Anglo American posts flat Q4 overall output, sees higher copper in 2022",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/anglo-american-posts-flat-q4-overall-output-sees-higher-copper-in-2022,,,"Updates, adds forecasts
LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Global miner Anglo American AAL.L said on Thursday its overall production for the fourth quarter was flat as a strong diamonds performance countered a 4% fall in copper, for which it expects higher output this year.
After producing 647,200 tonnes of copper in 2021, in line with the previous year, the London listed miner now expects between 680,000 and 760,000 tonnes for this year, driven by its new Quellaveco copper mine in Peru.
However, it warned about possible COVID-related disruptions and water shortages in Chile, where it mines the bulk of its copper.
""(At Quellaveco) We are on track and within budget, we mined our first ore in October 2021, and we are expecting our first production of copper concentrate in the middle of this year,"" Chief Executive Mark Cutifani said in a statement.
The miner expects Quellaveco to produce between 120,000 and 160,000 tonnes in 2022, followed by an average of 300,000 tonnes per year for the first 10 years at full production.
In the three months to December, rough diamond production rose by 15% from a year earlier mostly on increased output from Botswana and Namibia to meet renewed consumer demand.
Iron ore production fell 7% in the fourth quarter, due to unplanned maintenance at its Minas-Rio mine in Brazil, but was up 3% for the year at 63.8 million tonnes.
Its Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) operations more than doubled refined production in the fourth quarter, resulting in a record full-year refined production of 5.1 million ounces. For 2022, it expects to produce between 4.1 million and 4.5 million ounces.

941.0,2021-12-02 00:00:00 UTC,January 2022 Options Now Available For Alcoa (AA),AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/january-2022-options-now-available-for-alcoa-aa,,,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the January 2022 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new January 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $44.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $44.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $40.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $44.68/share today.
Because the $44.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.73% return on the cash commitment, or 65.59% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $44.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.65. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $44.68/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $45.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.89% if the stock gets called away at the January 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $45.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.17% boost of extra return to the investor, or 69.34% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 68%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 69%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $44.68) to be 63%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

2656.0,2023-04-21 00:00:00 UTC,5 Broker-Friendly Stocks to Monitor Amid Current Uncertainty,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-broker-friendly-stocks-to-monitor-amid-current-uncertainty,,,"With the Q1 earnings season still in its initial stages, investors would like to add stocks with the potential to surpass earnings expectations to their respective portfolios. This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation. However, the task of designing one’s portfolio with potential outperformers is quite a daunting one. The task becomes even more difficult in this scenario of high inflation and the resultant uncertainty and slowdown in consumer spending. Naturally, individual investors will find it next to impossible to design a winning portfolio of stocks without proper guidance amid this turbulence.

The choice of improper stocks can adversely impact returns, ruining the objective of investing one’s hard-earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market. In a bid to avoid such a scenario, investors usually rely on guidance from proper sources.

In the field of investing, brokers are deemed to be experts with thorough knowledge. We believe that investors should include broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, CVR Energy CVI, Cleveland-Cliffs CLF and Delek US Holdings DK in their watchlist
Why Broker Guidance is the Need of the Hour
Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. To attain their objective, they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations.  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.

Since brokers indulge in meticulous research, the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise. The direction of the estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters, it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason/logic behind their improving the recommendation on a particular stock.

To take care of the earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.
Ignore Top line at Your Own Peril
To design a winning strategy, it is not prudent to consider the bottom line only. In fact, according to some market watchers, a top-line outperformance is more creditable for a stock than a mere earnings beat under some circumstances. Therefore, to make our strategy full-proof, one needs to address top-line concerns as well. We have considered the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric, for screening stocks.
Screening Criteria
# (Up-Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.
% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.
Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio, the better. Companies meeting this criterion are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks.
Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely be of significant interest to most investors.
Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.
Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 in terms of market capitalization.
Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.
Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:
American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.
Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s 2023 earnings has been revised 14.8% upward. American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, is based in Atlanta, GA. DAL is being bolstered by an uptick in demand for air travel (particularly for leisure). Driven by higher air-travel demand, total revenues increased 36.5% on a year-over-year basis in first-quarter 2023.
High fuel costs are, however, a bane. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DAL’s 2023 earnings has been revised 3.1% upward.
CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high-value transportation fuels. CVI is also a producer of ammonia and urea ammonia nitrate fertilizers. Its petroleum business includes a full-coking sour crude refinery in Coffeyville, KS. The company’s efforts to reward its shareholders underline its strong financial position. The robust Nitrogen Fertilizer unit supports growth.
CVR Energy, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters by an average of 40.85%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 42.1% over the past 60 days.
Cleveland-Cliffs is a leading iron ore producer in the United States. It supplies differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major blast furnace steel producers in North America. The Mining and Pelletizing operation gains from low-cost, high-quality iron ore pellet production with substantial logistics and transportation advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market. The company should gain from its merger with AK Steel Holding Corporation.
Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLF’s 2023 earnings has been revised 13.7% upward. Cleveland-Cliffs currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Brentwood, TN-based Delek US Holdings is an independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. DK’s extensive downstream operations within the Permian Basin grant it a fairly significant competitive edge over its peers in the long term.
Delek US Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. DK surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one). The average beat is in excess of 100%.

The blue-chip barometer quickly plunged on the open, after the Conference Board reported that the consumer confidence gauge fell to 48.5 in September, hitting its lowest level since February. The news overshadowed a rise in the Case-Shiller home price index. The Dow rebounded from growing support in the 10,750 region, but has been unable gain a foothold above 10,850 in intraday trading.

In equity news, shares of Walgreen Co. ( WAG ) have soared more than 10% to hit a four-month high, as traders cheered the company's stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings report .

Analysts were looking for a profit of 44 cents per share. Looking ahead, Walgreen said it was ""confident"" that earnings would continue to grow.
Taking a closer look at this morning's economic data, the prices of single-family homes rose a non-seasonally unadjusted 0.6% in July, according to the Case-Shiller home price index.

However, the rise in home prices was overshadowed by a sharp drop in consumer confidence. Specifically, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 48.5 in September, hitting the lowest level since February. Economists were expecting a reading of 51.5. Within the report, consumers' expectations dropped to 65.4 in September, while the current conditions index fell to 23.1 - both readings were at their lowest levels since February.

4812.0,2021-01-07 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines' Policy Change To Allow Travel With Service Animals,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-policy-change-to-allow-travel-with-service-animals-2021-01-07,,,"(RTTNews) - American Airlines has unveiled proposed changes to its policies and procedures, allowing individuals with disabilities to travel with service animals.
Meanwhile, animals that previously traveled as emotional support animals and no longer qualify as service animals may travel as carry-on pets or as cargo pets, as long as they meet the requirements.
The forthcoming changes are in line with regulations that were issued recently by the U.S. Department of Transportation or DOT.
As per the DOT's new rule, a service animal is a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a qualified individual with a disability — a narrower definition than in the past.
The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline noted that when the rule goes into effect January 11, it will no longer authorize new travel for animals that do not meet that definition, such as emotional support animals. Existing bookings involving emotional support animals will be honored through February 1, when the airline's new policies go into effect.
Starting February 1, American will ask customers traveling with service animals to complete a DOT form attesting to the dog's behavior, training and health.
This form needs to be submitted electronically 48 hours in advance of a flight, unless the reservation is booked within 48 hours of travel. The authorization for a service animal will be valid for one year or until the expiration of its vaccinations.
The service animal forms, along with further new policy details, will be available on the company website in the coming days.

LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Global miner Anglo American's AAL.L first-quarter production fell 10% year on year, partly owing to operations running at reduced capacity because of higher rates of COVID-19 infections among workers, it said on Thursday.
The London-listed company also lowered full-year guidance on volumes for metals including platinum, iron ore and metallurgical coal to reflect inflationary price pressure that lifts its costs per unit of production.
Copper production fell 13% to 139,500 tonnes in the first quarter, from 160,300 tonnes in the same period last year, because of lower grades and is expected to reach between 660,000 and 750,000 tonnes for the full year.
Full-year unit cost guidance for copper production rose 5% to $0.147 per pound.
Iron ore production fell by 19% because of high rainfall at its Kumba and Minas-Rio operations, prompting a lowering of full-year guidance to between 60 million and 64 million tonnes from 63 million to 67 million tonnes previously.
Metallurgical coal production decreased by 32% while concentrate metal production from its platinum group metals operations in South Africa slipped by 6%, hit by high rainfall at Mogalakwena. Full-year guidance was lowered to between 3.9 million and 4.3 million ounces, from 4.1 million to 4.5 million ounces previously.
Rough diamond production, however, increased by 25% thanks to less disruption from rainfall in Botswana.

NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - New York officials on Wednesday celebrated the six-year $8 billion reconstruction of the city's long-derided LaGuardia airport with a brand new Delta Air Lines DAL.N terminal.
Delta's glittering 1.3 million-square foot $4 billion Terminal C will begin flights on Saturday at nine of the 37 new gates. Delta, the largest carrier at LaGuardia, is flying 255 flights daily to 70 cities this summer.
New York and airlines spent $8 billion to reconstruct the airport that then-Vice President Joe Biden in 2014 dubbed ""some third-world country.""
New York Governor Kathy Hochul did not forget Biden's earlier assessment. ""Come see this, President Biden, because your jaw is going to drop,"" Hochul said at a grand opening event.
Rick Cotton, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said LaGuardia had transformed from the ""most reviled airport in the nation"" into a world-class facility.
Airlines provided about two-thirds of the cost, with about $3.4 billion from Delta, New York said.
American Airlines AAL.O in 2020 opened its new arrivals and departures hall at LaGuardia Terminal B. In January, the $4 billion terminal redevelopment project was completed.
In 2017, New York and Delta broke ground to consolidate Terminals C and D into a single terminal across four concourses and a centralized departures and arrivals hall. The terminal features high-tech art work, power outlets at all seats and fancy new restaurants.
Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said that in 2017 ""it was the single biggest investment decision"" in the airline's history. Delta is investing more than $6 billion in New York's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International Airport, he added.
The new LaGuardia terminal includes Delta's largest airport lounge, a 34,000-square foot Sky Club with panoramic views that when finished can accommodate nearly 600 people.
In 2021, LaGuardia was the 25th busiest U.S. airport serving 7.8 million passengers. The New York City area, with three major airports, is the most congested airspace in the United states.
Airlines are forecasting record travel demand this summer as Americans who delayed trips during COVID-19 return to the skies.

LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator said it planned to assess a transatlantic partnership deal between British Airways-owner IAG ICAG.L, American Airlines AAL.O and Finnair FIA1S.HE in the context of the post-COVID recovery of the aviation market.
The Competition and Markets Authority's interest in competition on UK-U.S. airline routes stretches back to 2010.
The regulator had been due to conclude the latest phase of its investigation into the partnership during the pandemic, but decided to stick with existing measures during a period when there was little flying due to COVID travel restrictions.
It said on Thursday it would spend six months analysing and reviewing information on the partnership between the airlines, called the Atlantic Joint Business Agreement.
The current interim measures directive expires in 2026.

2423.0,2023-07-20 00:00:00 UTC,Aviation bill upping pilot retirement age to 67 passed by US House,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aviation-bill-upping-pilot-retirement-age-to-67-passed-by-us-house,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday voted to pass legislation that would raise the mandatory commercial pilot retirement age to 67 from 65 and make other aviation reforms, with the Senate now set to consider its own measure.
The vote in the Republican-led House was 351-69 to pass the bill that would reauthorize U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aviation safety and infrastructure programs for the next five years.
The Air Line Pilots Association has said hiking the retirement age could cause airline scheduling and pilot training issues and require reopening pilot contracts. Current international rules would still prevent pilots older than 65 from flying in most countries outside the United States.
The Regional Airline Association supports the pilot age hike, saying it ""allows retention of more experienced captains, who can in turn fly alongside and mentor new first officers, helping to stabilize attrition.""
The White House said this week it opposed a House bill provision that would rescind a 2012 Transportation Department regulation requiring airlines to advertise full fares including government fees and taxes. The House measure also did not include a provision sought by President Joe Biden to compensate passengers for delays or set minimum airline seat sizes.
The House measure would bar airlines from charging fees to allow families to sit together on flights. The House opted to retain pilot training rules that were adopted after a 2009 fatal passenger airplane crash near Buffalo. The bill did not include language allowing additional round-trip flights at Washington Reagan National Airport as sought by Delta Air Lines DAL.N.
Airlines for America, an industry trade group, praised the House passage and said it ""underscores the need to hire more air traffic controllers to ensure our airspace is adequately staffed.""
The Democratic-led Senate Appropriations Committee unanimously approved funding for the FAA on Thursday. That measure would allow the agency to hire 1,800 additional controllers next year. The Senate Commerce Committee could take up the FAA reauthorization bill as early as next week.
The Senate bill has been held up by a dispute over whether to change pilot training requirements that were imposed after the February 2009 crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 near Buffalo that killed 50 people, the last major U.S. passenger airline fatal crash.

4446.0,2021-05-31 00:00:00 UTC,Vote on Texas bill to make voting tougher blocked by no quorum,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vote-on-texas-bill-to-make-voting-tougher-blocked-by-no-quorum-2021-05-31,,,"By Brad Brooks
SAN ANTONIO, May 30 (Reuters) - Democrats in the Texas House of Representatives boycotted a legislative session late Sunday, blocking a vote on an election reform bill critics say would make it harder for Blacks and Hispanics to vote.
With just over an hour before a midnight deadline to pass the measure, Republican members of the House said that Democrats had walked out to deny the House a quorum for a vote.
The Texas House went into recess until 10 a.m. local time on Monday - beyond the midnight Sunday deadline to pass legislation in this session.
A vote on the measure is certain to pass the Republican-dominated house. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who strongly supports the bill, said in a late Sunday emailed statement that the bill would be added to a special legislative session planned for this fall.
Supporters of the legislation said it is needed to bolster election security. The country's second-most-populous state already has some of the most restrictive electoral laws in the United States, even without the pending bill.
The proposed bill states that the changes ""are not intended to impair the right of free suffrage"" but are necessary to ""prevent fraud in the electoral process.""
Republican U.S. Representative Michael McCaul of Texas told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the intent is to ""give the American people more trust in our elections.""
Democrats and civil rights groups argue that such legislation disproportionately burdens or discourages voters of color, as well as the elderly and disabled.
There were no substantial allegations of fraud in Texas in last year's election and Republicans maintained their three-decade grip on all statewide offices.
Republican state lawmakers across the country have pursued more stringent voting restrictions following former President Donald Trump's false claim that he lost the 2020 election because of widespread election fraud.
So far, 14 other U.S. states have enacted 22 laws this year that make it more difficult for Americans to vote, according to a report released on Friday by the Brennan Center for Justice.
SCRAPPING INNOVATIONS
The Texas bill would strike down innovations used during last November's election because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Drive-through voting, credited with helping spark record voter turnout in Houston, will no longer be allowed. The bill also limits early hours to vote, makes it more difficult to cast absentee ballots and does away with drop boxes.
The bill would forbid voting on Sundays before 1 p.m. Critics called that a blatant strike on the ""Souls to the Polls"" effort at Black churches, when worshippers have traditionally traveled in caravans to polling sites to cast votes after morning services.
The legislation would also scrap 24-hour polling sites and ban mobile units or temporary structures from being used as polling places.
The bill would also make it easier for courts to overturn elections where fraud is alleged. Instead of requiring evidence that fraudulent votes directly resulted in a candidate's win, a court could overturn an election if the number of fraudulent votes is equal to the margin of victory, regardless of who those fraudulent votes were cast for.
New requirements would take effect as well for Texans who want to vote through the mail and election officials would be barred from sending unsolicited mail-in ballot applications to voters. The legislation would also make the removal of disruptive, partisan poll watchers more difficult.
Democratic President Joe Biden said in a statement on Saturday that the legislation in Texas ""attacks the sacred right to vote.""
Earlier this month, dozens of companies - including American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co HPE.N and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O - urged legislators to reject any law restricting access to ballots.
'IN THEIR PLACE'
Members of the Texas Legislative Black Caucus and the state's NAACP civil rights organization said the bill hearkened back to the Jim Crow-era, when laws were enacted to block Blacks from voting and to maintain racial segregation in the U.S. South from the late 19th century into the 1960s.
""This is a clear case of taking power and putting minorities in their place so they can never share power in Texas,"" Gary Bledsoe, president of the state's NAACP chapter, said ahead of the vote.
Julian Castro, secretary of housing and urban development under former President Barack Obama and a former mayor of San Antonio, told a Democratic Party news conference that the rapidly shifting demographics of Texas had Republicans ""running scared because they know that this state is changing and they're afraid of the consequences.""
Hispanics are forecast by the official Texas state demographer to surpass non-Hispanic whites as the largest group later this year.
Former Democratic Representative Beto O'Rourke, speaking during the same news conference, urged the U.S. Congress to pass expanded voting rights to stymie the vote-restriction efforts in Republican-controlled states, so that the United States would not revert to ""Jim Crow 2.0.""

Q2 corporate earnings season is off to a strong start, as nearly 80% of U.S. companies that have reported results have beaten profit estimates.

Also, stronger-than-expected earnings results from Samsung Electronics sparked a rally in Japanese electronics makers.  Gains in the overall market were limited as the yen moved higher against the dollar, undercutting exporter stocks.  The yen rose on short covering ahead of Friday’s BOJ meeting in case policymakers decide to tweak the BOJ’s ultra-loose monetary policy.

3570.0,2022-04-28 00:00:00 UTC,United Airlines Stock Stands to Benefit From International Travel Market,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/united-airlines-stock-stands-to-benefit-from-international-travel-market,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Recently, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) announced that it will be dramatically increasing its capacity of Transatlantic flights. This comes ahead of the summer flying season, as United seeks to capitalize on a swift recovery in passenger traffic levels. Already, domestic U.S. travel has enjoyed a solid rebound, and United’s management team is now placing a significant bet on a similar upswing overseas. Here’s what it means for UAL stock.
United already had significantly more international flights than either Delta (NYSE:DAL) or American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) as per data from research firm Cirium. Now, with this added capacity, United will be far and away the largest U.S.-based international carrier. The company plans to take its capacity to fully 25% above its pre-pandemic levels. That’s a huge increase given the remaining amount of uncertainty in the global travel market. United will move to having 22 daily flights between the U.S. and London, and is adding flights to new destinations such as the Canary Islands of Spain and Portugal’s Azores Islands among others.
7 Long-Term Stocks to Buy for a Robust Retirement
International flying is generally attractive for airlines. That’s not only for the higher ticket yields, but also the broader possibilities. A bigger international network improves the value of code-sharing and alliance programs with international carriers. Loyalty programs are a big piece of the pie for airlines, so United is making a power play to bolster its standing on that front.
For another, with business travel being slower to recover, premium international destinations could become the major new growth driver for airlines as they seek to adapt to changing conditions. Tourism-centered routes such as to the Canaries could represent an interesting strategic shift for United over the longer-term.
A big part of this strategy swings on higher fuel costs. Given the far longer routes we’re talking about here, it will be important to maintain high load factors on these flights. Flying a half-empty jet over the Atlantic comes at a higher cost than doing so between New York and Boston. So United will need to get the math right in terms of which routes it adds and at what capacity. But it’s nice to see them being willing to take a big swing like this. United’s move represents an airline that is lifting off out of crisis mode and is operating from a position of strength. That could well reflect itself in the value of UAL stock going forward, as well.

1803.0,2011-03-08 00:00:00 UTC,Good Things Come in Aluminum Packages for Alcoa,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/good-things-come-aluminum-packages-alcoa-2011-03-08,,,"Alcoa ( AA ) is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum and alumina, and competes with other international metals and mining giants like Rusal, Rio Tinto ( RIO ), BHP Billiton ( BHP ) and Chalco ( ACH ).
Its products are used worldwide in aircrafts, automobiles, commercial transportation, packaging, building and construction, oil and gas, defense, and industrial applications. The company also sells non-aluminum products including precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners.
Our price estimate for Alcoa, at $17.68 , implies a 7% premium to market price.
The Packaging Industry Drives Demand for Aluminum in a Big Way…
The packaging industry uses a significant quantity of aluminum. The metal's light weight makes it ideal for making cans. Moreover, it is very convenient to use aluminum foil for wrapping and storing food. It is estimated that almost 20% of all aluminum produced is used for packaging. With the global demand for the aluminum industry expected to reach 45 million tons by 2012, it implies that almost 9 million tons of aluminum will be used for packaging by then.
Moreover, a few independent researches have recently shown that aluminum beverage bottles can actually provide insulation comparable to glass bottles. Puzzling as this discovery is, it has the potential to boost the usage of aluminium by giving the metal access to the bottling industry which has been dominated completely by glass and plastic.
… But Will this Actually Translate to Any Benefit for Alcoa?
Any factor that can increase the demand for aluminum in theglobal marketis bound to add value to all aluminum manufacturing companies world-wide, as it represents an increase in sales revenues. With Alcoa being the front-runner in the industry, this would represent a significant upside for the company in the years to come.
But in the recent past, all aluminum manufacturers have faced a threat to their profitability due to increasing focus on environmental sustainability. Aluminum production requires a substantial amount of electricity. In fact, electricity costs are second only to the cost of acquiring bauxite ore. This, combined with the fact that aluminum is 100% recyclable at a fraction of its manufacturing costs, has spawned an extremely profitable recycled-aluminum industry.
The increase in use of recycled aluminium is the U.S. is what most likely prompted Alcoa's CEO Mr. Klaus Kleinfeld to predict flat growth in the usage of aluminum in the country for 2011.
See our full analysis and $17.68 price estimate for Alcoa
We believe Alcoa's primary metals sales figure could increase by as much as 10% by the end of our forecast period, pushing our estimated shipments to 5 million tons at that point. This would in-turn represent a 7.5% upside to our $17.68 price estimate for Alcoa , bringing our number to $19.

4504.0,2021-04-26 00:00:00 UTC,3 Stocks to Avoid This Week,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-avoid-this-week-2021-04-26,,,"I took a look at three stocks to avoid last week, predicting that Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN), American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL), and Travelzoo (NASDAQ: TZOO) would have a bad week.
Coinbase was a big loser last week. It slipped every single trading day, plunging 15% along the way. Some of the shine was already starting to come off of this month's hot debutante, but it certainly didn't help that crypto prices were correcting sharply last week.
American Airlines declined 4% for the week. It reported mixed quarterly results. The legacy air carrier is seeing bookings start to pick up, but rising costs may eat away at a potential recovery.
Finally we have Travelzoo matching American Airlines with its own 4% descent last week. The travel deals publisher saw its quarterly revenue decline 30% from a week earlier, but there was better-than-expected sequential improvement. It wasn't enough to impress the market.
The three stocks averaged a 7.7% slide for the week. The S&P 500 was roughly flat for the week, with a 0.1% decline that was better than all three declining stocks. This is the second week in a row where all three stocks fall in a flat or rising market. This week, I see Coinbase Global, Six Flags Entertainment (NYSE: SIX), and MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) as vulnerable investments in the near term. Here's why I think these are three stocks to avoid this week.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Coinbase Global
Last week's crypto correction rocked Coinbase. The leading cryptocurrencies were showing signs of weakness even before buzz about a big tax hike on capital gains for the country's wealthiest earners ate into the market's enthusiasm.
Corrections are normal, and in many ways healthy. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and other viable digital currencies should bounce back. The problem here is that Coinbase itself was overvalued and vulnerable. The leading marketplace for all things crypto is facing stiff competition in the near future, and it will have to cut its trading commissions if it wants to remain the top dog. I remain a long-term bull on cryptocurrency stocks in general, but Coinbase remains overpriced at 45 times trailing revenue.
2. Six Flags Entertainment
I have a soft spot for thrill rides and regional amusement parks. I'm proud to say that 67 of the 219 roller coasters that I have ridden -- yes, I do keep track -- are Six Flags attractions. However, with the thrill maker reporting financial results on Wednesday I do have my near-term concerns on the chain as an investment.
The stock is trading much higher than it was in the months leading up to the pandemic, and that's problematic. Don't get me wrong. Folks are clamoring for diversions. The economy is going to bounce back a lot faster than worrywarts thing with all of the money that we collectively saved during the past year. However, Six Flags still isn't worth more than it was before the COVID-19 crisis.
Wednesday morning's report may not seem very relevant. The first three months of the year are soft for this seasonal operator. Analysts see a 53% year-over-year decline in revenue, but Six Flags will talk up the upcoming summer season with strong pass sales and buoyant attendance at parks that have already opened. One trend that isn't so kind is that it has posted a larger-than-expected loss in each of its last three quarters. Until that streak is snapped, Six Flags doesn't deserve to be trading near an 18-month high.
3. MicroStrategy
If you like your enterprise software companies with a side of crypto you may as well order a plate of MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy is a meandering provider of enterprise analytics, and these days it's the CEO's commitment to Bitcoin on its balance sheet that is the real entree here.
The business itself of MicroStrategy will not impress you. It's a profitable platform, but it has seen its revenue decline for six consecutive quarters. Shrinking in a market that is actually growing is not a good sign. The silver lining at MicroStrategy is that founder CEO Michael Saylor has been investing the company's cash reserves in Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has spent $2.21 billion to acquire 91,326 Bitcoin tokens.
At the crypto's peak of nearly $65,000 two weeks ago, MicroStrategy's stake was valued at more than $5.9 billion. At a recent price of $48,000 as of early Sunday evening, we're not at $4.4 billion. MicroStrategy commands an enterprise value of $6.5 billion, but it's not as if the fading analytics business was worth more than $2 billion before Saylor's obsession with Bitcoin.
I think Saylor is right about Bitcoin, but it's hard to get investors excited about near-term upside when the world's leading crypto is going the wrong way. MicroStrategy reports financial results after Thursday's market close, and it will be hard to get the market excited unless Bitcoin stages a huge rally in the next few days.
If you're looking for safe stocks, you aren't likely to find them in Coinbase, Six Flags, and MicroStrategy this week.

3235.0,2022-09-27 00:00:00 UTC,"U.S. antitrust trial against American Airlines, JetBlue alliance kicks off",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-antitrust-trial-against-american-airlines-jetblue-alliance-kicks-off,,,"WASHINGTON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department goes to court Tuesday to ask a judge to order American Airlines AAL.O and JetBlue Airways JBLU.O to scrap a partnership in the U.S. Northeast in a high-stakes fight that follows painful court losses for the government.
The trial, expected to last about three weeks, takes place at a time when critics say prior administrations allowed the U.S. aviation industry to become too consolidated, leading to high prices and sometimes poor treatment of consumers.
The government will argue the partnership known as the Northeast Alliance, unveiled by American Airlines and JetBlue in July 2020, meant that the two companies effectively merged their operations in Boston and New York because they pool revenue on flights into and out of Boston Logan, John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports.
The alliance, they will argue, will defang JetBlue, a maverick carrier that often offers better fares than legacy carriers. They will also argue that the alliance gave the two airlines more than 80% market share in flights from Boston to Washington, DC and six other airports.
The companies are expected to argue that the alliance is pro-competitive because it allows the companies to better compete with Delta Air Lines DAL.N and United AirlinesUAL.O by allowing the companies to increase capacity. JetBlue, they will say, will remain a maverick.
American is the world's largest airline. It, Delta, United and Southwest Airlines LUV.N control over 80% of domestic travel, the government argues.
JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes is the first witness that the government plans to call. Hayes has said that no matter how this proceeding ends up, it will be good for JetBlue's effort to buy Spirit SAVE.N.
""We've had a better effect on lowering fares than low-cost carriers,"" Hayes told Reuters earlier this year.
The trial starts after a week in which judges ruled against the government in two antitrust fights - sugar and insurance.

Aug 3 (Reuters) - U.S. travel stocks fell in early trading on Thursday following downbeat quarterly reports from Spirit Airlines SAVE.N and Expedia EXPE.O that amplified concerns domestic demand may be easing after a strong rebound from pandemic lows.
Spirit, which mainly operates on domestic routes, also forecast weaker-than-expected revenue for the third quarter, with Citi analysts citing the effect from travel demand shifting to international from domestic.
The airline, which also missed second-quarter profit and revenue estimates, has also struggled with pilot attrition and geared turbofan engine issues.
Its shares fell 5.7% in morning trade as current-quarter revenue forecast of between $1.30 billion and $1.32 billion came in below expectations of $1.51 billion, as per Refinitiv data.
Last week, Southwest Airlines LUV.N and Alaska Air ALK.N had offered downbeat full-year forecasts.
Shares of large U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines DAL.N, United Airlines UAL.O and American Airlines AAL.O slipped about 1%, while Southwest fell about 2%.
Adding to the gloom, online travel firm Expedia Inc EXPE.O reported smaller-than-expected bookings for the second quarter, even as it said travel demand remained ""strong.""
Gross bookings of $27.32 billion missed analysts' estimates of $28.16 billion.
Revenue from points of sale in the U.S. fell to $2.17 billion from $2.21 billion, while international sales rose.
""We believe this is further evidence of softening in U.S. travel demand trends while international growth continues to outperform,"" Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt said in a note.
U.S. domestic airfares had seen some declines as capacity increases, company executives said during an investor call, while cross-border airfares were stable.
Expedia's shares plunged 14% to $101.29.
The company reported an adjusted profit of $2.89 per share, beating expectations of $2.32 but revenue of $3.36 billion was slightly below expectations.
Tripadvisor TRIP.O and Trivago's TVAGy.F U.S-listed shares were down 8.6% and 3.3%, respectively.
Shares of vacation rental firm Airbnb ABNB.O, which reports results later on Thursday, were down 1.5%.

The rise was mainly due to recovery in the aluminum prices as global lockdowns were gradually being lifted. But will Alcoa’s stock continue its upward trajectory over the coming weeks, or is a correction in the stock more likely?
According to the Trefis Machine Learning Engine, which identifies trends in a company’s historical stock price data, returns for Alcoa stock average close to -8.6% in the next one-month (21 trading days) period after experiencing a 69% rise over the previous six-month (126 trading days) period. Notably, though, the stock is likely to underperform the S&P500 over the next month, with an expected return which would be 9.6% lower compared to the S&P500.
But how would these numbers change if you are interested in holding Alcoa stock for a shorter or a longer time period? You can test the answer and many other combinations on the Trefis Machine Learning Engine to test Alcoa stock chances for a rise after a fall and vice versa. You can test the chance of recovery over different time intervals of a quarter, month, or even just 1 day!
MACHINE LEARNING ENGINE – try it yourself:
IF Alcoa stock moved by -5% over 5 trading days, THEN over the next 21 trading days, Alcoa stock moves an average of 1.2 percent, which implies a return which is 1 percent lower than that of the S&P500.
More importantly, there is a 46% probability of a positive return over the next 21 trading days and 39% probability of a positive excess return after a -5% change over 5 trading days.
  Some Fun Scenarios, FAQs & Making Sense of Alcoa Stock Movements:
Question 1: Is the average return for Alcoa stock higher after a drop?
Answer:
Consider two situations,
Case 1: Alcoa stock drops by -5% or more in a week
Case 2: Alcoa stock rises by 5% or more in a week
Is the average return for Alcoa stock higher over the subsequent month after Case 1 or Case 2?
AA stock fares almost similar in both cases, with an average return of 1.2% over the next month (21 trading days) under Case 1 (where the stock has just suffered a 5% loss over the previous week), similar to an average return of 1.2% for Case 2.
In comparison, the S&P 500 has an average return of 3.1% over the next 21 trading days under Case 1, and an average return of just 0.5% for Case 2 as detailed in our dashboard that details the average return for the S&P 500 after a fall or rise.
Try the Trefis machine learning engine above to see for yourself how Alcoa stock is likely to behave after any specific gain or loss over a period.
Question 2: Does patience pay?
Answer:
If you buy and hold Alcoa stock, the expectation is over time the near term fluctuations will cancel out, and the positive trend over the next month and next quarter will favor you – at least if the company is otherwise strong.

2512.0,2023-06-27 00:00:00 UTC,S.African mines seek to turn up renewables to ease power crisis,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/s.african-mines-seek-to-turn-up-renewables-to-ease-power-crisis,,,"By Nelson Banya
JOHANNESBURG, June 27 (Reuters) - South African miners have increased their efforts to bring on new solar and wind generation, renewables company JUWI said, as they seek to cut costs and emissions and address an electricity crisis that has hit their output and the wider economy.
Frequent breakdowns by state-owned utility Eskom's ageing coal-fired plants have led to extensive power cuts.
Mines and their processing facilities, which account for up to 30% of the nation's power consumption, are routinely asked to reduce their use with major implications for their mineral output.
South Africa is the world's biggest producer of platinum group metals (PGMs). Sibanye Stillwater SSWJ.J has estimated South Africa's PGM output could fall by up to 20% this year, when production from the world number two producer Russia has been constrained as a result of its invasion of Ukraine.
JUWI South Africa, a unit of the German-headquartered renewable energy project developer, has received ""a wave of requests"" from local mines, its Managing Director Richard Doyle told Reuters.
""This is driven partly by the energy crisis, partly by increases in electricity pricing and a strong global decarbonisation drive,"" Doyle said.
He added JUWI is developing 400 megawatts of renewable energy projects for South African mines and said energy sector reforms announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa last year, which included the removal of licencing restrictions, had given momentum to private power projects.
South African mining companies are developing a combined 6,500 megawatts of renewable power, the country's Minerals Council said. They are expected to generate 2,294 megawatts of their own power by 2025, with more expected onstream by 2030.
Miners that have said they are pursuing renewable power include Anglo American Plc AAL.L, Impala Platinum IMPJ.J and Sibanye.
Sibanye at the end of May signed a power purchase deal with an 89 MW wind project, as it aims for a target of 550 MW renewable power by 2040.
It said the project would play ""a pivotal role"" in reducing carbon emissions as well as yielding cost savings and improving energy security.

WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration plans to extend requirements for travelers to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses and at airports and train stations through Jan. 18 to address ongoing COVID-19 risks, three sources told Reuters.
Major U.S. airlines were informed of the planned extension on a call with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday, the three people briefed on the matter said.
The current TSA transportation mask order runs through Sept 13.
TSA declined comment and CDC officials did not immediately comment.
The current CDC order, which has been in place since soon after Biden took office in January, requires the use of face masks on nearly all forms of public transportation.
It requires face masks to be worn by all travelers on airplanes, ships, trains, subways, buses, taxis and ride-shares and at transportation hubs such as airports, bus or ferry terminals, train and subway stations and seaports.
The requirements have been the source of some friction, especially aboard U.S. airlines, where some travelers have refused to wear masks. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Tuesday that since Jan. 1 it has received reports from airlines of 2,867 passengers refusing to wear a mask.

3393.0,2022-07-15 00:00:00 UTC,Previewing The Airliners: Can Shares Take Flight?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/previewing-the-airliners%3A-can-shares-take-flight,,,"Earnings season kicks off next week. Investors are more than eager for companies to unveil their quarterly results to understand better how they have navigated the rough economic waters we’ve found ourselves in.
A trio of airliners – United Air Lines UAL, American Air Lines AAL, and Southwest Airlines LUV – are all slated to release quarterly results within the next two weeks.
All three companies reside in the Zacks Transportation – Airline Industry, which has tumbled 22% year-to-date. The chart below illustrates the year-to-date performance of all three companies.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
It’s worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic crushed demand but is quickly returning. Additionally, soaring fuel costs have undoubtedly impacted margins, and we saw this in Delta Air Lines’ DAL Q2 report; DAL missed the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by a double-digit 16% but posted a 1.6% top-line beat.
Let’s take a closer view of each company to see how they shape up heading into next week.
United Air Lines
United Air Lines UAL is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of an A. Over the last 60 days, analysts have substantially raised their earnings outlook across several timeframes.
For the quarter to be reported, the Consensus Estimate Trend has increased by 43%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate for the upcoming quarter resides at $1.86, penciling in a massive triple-digit increase in earnings of nearly 150% year-over-year.
In addition, the quarterly revenue estimate of $12 billion notches a triple-digit 120% expansion in the top-line from the year-ago quarter.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company sports a 0.3X forward price-to-sales ratio, nicely below its five-year median value of 0.5X and well underneath highs of 0.9X in 2020. In addition, the value represents an enticing 83% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
UAL’s bottom-line results have primarily been mixed; over its last ten quarterly reports, the airliner has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate five times.
American Air Lines
American Air Lines AAL is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of a B. Analysts have extensively upped their earnings estimates for the current fiscal year and the upcoming quarter over the last 60 days.
The Consensus Estimate Trend for the upcoming quarter has soared by 44%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Currently, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate resides at $0.79, reflecting a triple-digit 145% uptick in quarterly earnings from the year-ago quarter.
Furthermore, the airliner is forecasted to generate $13.4 billion in revenue, good enough for a sizable double-digit 80% increase in quarterly revenue year-over-year.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
American Airlines boasts a 0.2X forward price-to-sales ratio, just above its five-year median value of 0.1X and nowhere near highs of 0.6X in 2020. Additionally, the value represents a solid 89% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
AAL has recently displayed consistency within its bottom-line, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in seven consecutive quarters.
Southwest Airlines
Southwest Airlines LUV is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an overall VGM Score of an A. Similar to AAL and UAL, analysts have positively revised their earnings estimates substantially across several timeframes.
The Consensus Estimate Trend for the upcoming quarter has climbed 18.5% over the last 60 days.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
For the upcoming quarterly release, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate resides at $1.15, reflecting a jaw-dropping 430% growth in quarterly earnings year-over-year.
In addition, Southwest is forecasted to rake in $6.7 billion in revenue for the quarter, notching a 70% increase in revenue from the year-ago quarter.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Southwest currently sports a 0.9X forward price-to-sales ratio, which is well below its five-year median value of 1.5X and nowhere near highs of 3.1X in 2020. Furthermore, the value represents a 36% discount relative to its Zacks Sector.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
The company has primarily reported bottom-line results above expectations; Southwest has exceeded the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate seven times over its last ten quarterly reports.
Bottom Line
All three companies are expected to register substantial top and bottom-line growth, a reflection of the travel industry recovering following a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic that locked the world inside.
However, soaring costs are expected to weigh heavily on margins, a common theme we will see during the second round of quarterly results in 2022.
Delta Air Lines’ DAL quarterly report revealed that higher fuel costs negatively affected its bottom-line. In addition, shares didn’t react well to the quarterly release; shares lost nearly 5% in value following the report. Investors should be aware of the soaring costs that these airliners have had to face.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

1032.0,2021-06-06 00:00:00 UTC,"The Executive VP & General Counsel of Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA), Jeffrey Heeter, Just Sold 87% Of Their Holding",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-executive-vp-general-counsel-of-alcoa-corporation-nyse%3Aaa-jeffrey-heeter-just-sold-87,,,"Some Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) shareholders may be a little concerned to see that the Executive VP & General Counsel, Jeffrey Heeter, recently sold a substantial US$936k worth of stock at a price of US$40.53 per share. That diminished their holding by a very significant 87%, which arguably implies a strong desire to reallocate capital.
Alcoa Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
Notably, that recent sale by Jeffrey Heeter is the biggest insider sale of Alcoa shares that we've seen in the last year. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$38.84. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).
Insiders in Alcoa didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!

Insider Ownership of Alcoa
Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Alcoa insiders own about US$29m worth of shares. That equates to 0.4% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.
So What Do The Alcoa Insider Transactions Indicate?
Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

1335.0,2013-07-19 00:00:00 UTC,How Do You Call a Bottom? - Real Time Insight,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-do-you-call-bottom-real-time-insight-2013-07-19,,,"It has long been my view that calling a turn in the global economy is best done by calling a turn in industrial metals markets. This week offered me a first hint on that turn.
As you may or may not know, aluminum prices -- a core industrial metal -- remain near three-year lows. A respected consensus of 40 metals analysts believes these to be the primary causes: weak demand conditions and high inventory levels.
Recent U.S. dollar strength and a big upturn in aluminum stock levels centered at the London Metals Exchange (the LME), the primary global trading center for aluminum, have helped depress the metal.
Downward price pressure on aluminum intensified in early June, despite reports major smelters - notably Chalco in China - started to reduce production and close down unprofitable plants in scale.
Some observers believe aluminum producers struggle to make money at prices below $2,000 per ton. On July 17 th , aluminum prices were $1,773 per ton, which translates to $0.80 cents per pound. That's mighty unprofitable.
Now, here is the surprise consensus forecast!
Aluminum prices, according to this same consensus of 40 firms, mostly based in London, are set to rise from a bottom at $1800 per ton to $2200 per ton by December 2014. That is a strong +22% upward move. Their next bullish metals? -- Gold and Copper. From the same June survey, this consensus forecast sees a price appreciation of less than +5% here.
Aluminum price weakness has hit a major U.S. based producer hard. Alcoa, which was once a $30 stock, now trades around $8 a share. It is a Zacks Rank #4 in the Mining - Non Ferrous Metals industry, currently ranked a dismal #240 out of 259 industries. Its long-term Zacks Rating is Neutral. Leading the reasons to sell Alcoa shares is ""weak pricing"" in nearly all sell-side reports.
Turning to the brighter sides of tough market forces, weak aluminum prices have brought down Alcoa's cost structure in the past three years. According to a Zacks covering analyst, Alcoa is divesting underperforming assets through its restructuring program and is aggressively pursuing cost-cutting actions.
In addition, aluminum business segment volumes are very cyclical. Healthy demand in the aerospace market is expected to drive results moving ahead. However, weakness remains in the commercial building and construction market.
It all sums up to a compelling forward-looking picture. Alcoa's annual earnings estimates are for $0.40 a share for 2013, but lift to $0.64 a share in 2014. That is a +60% improvement going forward. Its P/E on the forward 2014 estimate is a nice 12.4, a good spot for a value investor when the S&500 index is trading around 15 times forward earnings.
My Real Time Insight weekend question for you?
How Do You Call a Bottom?
Your choices:
I am a first mover. I look at this forecast for strong consensus aluminum price appreciation and get bullish now.
I will look for industry segment volumes to pick up amid reduced inventories.
I will wait for an upgrade in Alcoa's Zacks Rank to a #2 or #1.
I want to see the Zacks Industry Rank for Metals-Non Ferrous break into the top one third of all industries.
I want to see a turn in Chinese real GDP.
All I need is to see is a major positive policy catalyst out of Chinese authorities.
I want to see a turn in Europe's real GDP.
I will look for Alcoa's stock to break $9 or $10 a share.
Other.
Realize this: Answers here are much greater than calling a turn in aluminum markets. Your choice amounts to calling a turn in the global economy.

4724.0,2021-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,ANALYSIS-The other winners of the Reddit-fueled rallies: convertible debt,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-the-other-winners-of-the-reddit-fueled-rallies%3A-convertible-debt-2021-02-05,,,"By Kate Duguid and Matt Scuffham
NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Among the winners from the recent retail-driven frenzy in U.S. stocks are investors in the niche market of convertible debt, capping a year of gains for the securities and potentially drawing new interest.
While buyout firm Silver Lake capitalized on a surge in AMC Entertainment AMC.N, one of the stocks at the epicenter of the retail frenzy linked to a convertible bond, others have also seen their bonds gain.
Those holding convertible notes - which allow investors to convert the debt to equity when a company's shares hit a set price - in Ligand Pharmaceuticals LGND.O, 53220KAF5=, 53220KAE8= have seen prices rise 10% since Jan. 25. Over the same period, the American Airlines AAL.O, 02376RAF9= convertible note rose to a record high, as did that of First Majestic Silver FR.TO, 32076VAA1=, 32076VAB9=, last up 9% and 14% respectively. All three stocks were pushed higher in the retail buying rush.
""This is why you buy convertibles,"" said Geoff Dancey, portfolio manager at Cutler Capital Management, who bought into the Ligand convertible bond just before the Reddit rally.
""We are benefiting from the rise, the same way as equity investors,"" said Arnaud Brillois, who manages the global convertible portfolio at Lazard Asset Management. He noted that not all stocks that rose last week are linked to convertible bonds, which allow investors to gain from dramatic jumps in share prices but also pay a coupon like a traditional bond.
""When you have a stock going up, the convertible bond is going to capture a large part of the equity's rise,"" said Brillois. ""The convertible bond will perform approximately 950% or 970% when the equity is doing 1000%.""
Two hedge fund investors who requested anonymity because they could not speak publicly about their positions said the market volatility also provided hedge funds with an opportunity to profit. They buy the convertible bonds of companies whose stock has soared and hedge their position by shorting the shares.
""This (retail) development has spurred a whole group of funds to adopt that strategy,"" said a source who runs a U.S. hedge fund.
That arbitrage strategy - which takes advantage of differences in price between the debt and equity - has been utilized by funds like CQS, AQR Capital Management, Man Group and Whitebox Advisors, among others.
Last week's market mania ""benefited the private equity firms or whoever owned the bonds greatly; it benefited the company because they don't have to pay back the debt, and it probably did not benefit whoever it was that was buying up that stock that hit crazy levels,"" said Todd Pulvino, co-founder of CNH Partners, an affiliate of AQR that trades convertible arbitrage.
Gil Song, portfolio manager at Man GLG, said large, unexpected moves in stocks that benefit convertible arbitrage investors may become more common.
""Given recent estimates of retail participation in the market having doubled in the past two years alone, one might infer increased volatility is here to stay for at least some time,"" said Song.
Whitebox Advisors declined to comment and CQS did not respond to a request for comment.
While the Reddit rally has shown signs of weakening, two of the largest exchange-traded funds that track the convertible market, the iShares Convertible Bond ETF ICVT.Z and the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Convertible Securities ETF CWB.P, hit all-time highs on Friday morning.

691.0,2022-07-25 00:00:00 UTC,Is Most-Watched Stock Alcoa (AA) Worth Betting on Now?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-most-watched-stock-alcoa-aa-worth-betting-on-now-0,,,"Alcoa (AA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company have returned -7.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Metal Products - Distribution industry, which Alcoa falls in, has gained 3.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
For the current quarter, Alcoa is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share, indicating a change of -68.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -80.1% over the last 30 days.
For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.27 points to a change of +6.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -37.4%.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.98 indicates a change of -4% from what Alcoa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -41%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alcoa is rated Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Alcoa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.17 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $13.27 billion and $13.11 billion estimates indicate +9.2% and -1.2% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Alcoa reported revenues of $3.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.6%. EPS of $2.67 for the same period compares with $1.49 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.33%. The EPS surprise was +2.69%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Alcoa is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alcoa. However, its Zacks Rank #5 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.

Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2021. Previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.

211.0,2023-02-28 00:00:00 UTC,Agilent Technologies (A) Surpasses Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/agilent-technologies-a-surpasses-q1-earnings-and-revenue-estimates,,,"Agilent Technologies (A) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.37 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.21 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.58%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this scientific instrument maker would post earnings of $1.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.53, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
Agilent, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Testing Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.76 billion for the quarter ended January 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.78%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.67 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Agilent shares have lost about 5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 3.7%.
What's Next for Agilent?
While Agilent has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Agilent: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.28 on $1.64 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.64 on $6.95 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Testing Equipment is currently in the top 32% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
One other stock from the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Iridex (IRIX), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2022. The results are expected to be released on March 9.
This medical laser company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +26.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.
Iridex's revenues are expected to be $15.17 million, down 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.

220.0,2023-02-23 00:00:00 UTC,Should You Invest in the First Trust Water ETF (FIW)?,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-invest-in-the-first-trust-water-etf-fiw,,,"If you're interested in broad exposure to the Industrials - Water segment of the equity market, look no further than the First Trust Water ETF (FIW), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 05/08/2007.
While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.
Sector ETFs are also funds of convenience, offering many ways to gain low risk and diversified exposure to a broad group of companies in particular sectors. Industrials - Water is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 2, placing it in top 13%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors. It has amassed assets over $1.30 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Industrials - Water segment of the equity market. FIW seeks to match the performance of the ISE Clean Edge Water Index before fees and expenses.
The ISE Clean Edge Water Index is a modified market capitalization-weighted index comprised of exchange-listed companies that derive a substantial portion of their revenues from the potable and wastewater industry.
Costs
Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.53%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.64%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Industrials sector--about 54.20% of the portfolio. Utilities and Healthcare round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Idexx Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX) accounts for about 5.11% of total assets, followed by Xylem Inc. (XYL) and Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A).
The top 10 holdings account for about 41.89% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
The ETF return is roughly 5.29% and it's up approximately 5.25% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 02/23/2023), respectively. FIW has traded between $67.71 and $86.50 during this last 52-week period.
The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 27.67% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 37 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.
Alternatives
First Trust Water ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, FIW is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
Invesco S&P Global Water Index ETF (CGW) tracks S&P GLOBAL WATER INDEX and the Invesco Water Resources ETF (PHO) tracks NASDAQ OMX US Water Index. Invesco S&P Global Water Index ETF has $977.53 million in assets, Invesco Water Resources ETF has $1.78 billion. CGW has an expense ratio of 0.57% and PHO charges 0.59%.

2992.0,2023-01-13 00:00:00 UTC,Airbus withdraws from U.S. FAA Boeing safety culture panel,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/airbus-withdraws-from-u.s.-faa-boeing-safety-culture-panel,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus AIR.PA said it had withdrawn from a U.S. government-named panel reviewing Boeing’s BA.N safety processes and how they influence Boeing safety culture after two fatal 737 MAX crashes in recent years killed 346 people.
The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) panel includes MIT lecturer and aerospace engineer Javier de Luis whose sister was killed in a MAX crash, as well as experts from NASA, the FAA, labor unions, Southwest Airlines LUV.N, American Airlines AAL.O, United Airlines UAL.O, GE Aviation GE.N and FedEx Express FDX.N.
Among those named was James Tidball, head of certification for Airbus Americas. Airbus said in a statement to Reuters it appreciated the FAA's recognition of Tidball's impartiality concerning safety but given ""the panel’s focus on a particular (Original Equipment Manufacturer, Tidball)... has decided to recuse himself from this working group.""
The panel, which Congress required under a 2020 law to reform how the FAA certifies new airplanes, has nine months to complete its review and issue findings and recommendations. Congress directed the agency to appoint a panel by early 2021, but the FAA missed that deadline.
A 2020 U.S. House report said the MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 ""were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing's engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing's management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA.""
Boeing last week declined to comment on the panel, but previously emphasized it has significantly reformed its safety culture after the MAX crashes cost it more than $20 billion.
Last month, Congress voted to lift a Dec. 27 deadline imposing a new safety standard for modern cockpit alerts for two new versions of the 737 MAX aircraft that could have put the future of those new models at risk.
In May, the FAA opted to renew Boeing's Organization Designation Authorization (ODA) program for three years rather than the five years Boeing sought.
The FAA continues to subject Boeing to enhanced oversight, inspecting all new Boeing 737 MAXs and 787s before they can be delivered.

June 20 (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways JBLU.O said Monday it had boosted its takeover offer for Spirit Airlines SAVE.N to $33.50 as it works to convince the ultra-low cost carrier to accept its offer over rival Frontier Airlines' proposal ULCC.O.
Spirit said last week it was in talks with JetBlue JBLU.O over its offer and expected to decide on the proposal by June 30. JetBlue said its proposal represents a 68% premium to the implied value of the Frontier stock and cash transaction.
The new proposal includes what JetBlue termed a ""stronger divestiture commitment"" to complete the Spirit deal but does not include abandoning JetBlue's Northeast Alliance with American Airlines AAL.O.

The put contract at the $21.00 strike price has a current bid of 41 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $21.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $20.59 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AAL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $23.80/share today.
Because the $21.00 strike represents an approximate 12% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.95% return on the cash commitment, or 16.57% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for American Airlines Group Inc, and highlighting in green where the $21.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $27.50 strike price has a current bid of 21 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of AAL stock at the current price level of $23.80/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $27.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 16.43% if the stock gets called away at the July 9th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AAL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for American Airlines Group Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AAL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $27.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $27.50 strike represents an approximate 16% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.88% boost of extra return to the investor, or 7.49% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $23.80) to be 74%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Visa Inc.

Top Research Reports for Visa, Marriott International and Parker-Hannifin
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Visa Inc., Marriott International, Inc. and Parker-Hannifin Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today's research reports here >>>

Visa's shares have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+20.9% vs. +15.7%). The company's stock prices has consistently outperformed the industry, driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.

The fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings beat estimates, fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.

However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such the stock warrants a cautious stance.

Shares of Marriott International have outperformed the Zacks Hotels and Motels industry over the year-to-date period (+40.6% vs. +22.9%). The company's upside was backed by robust leisure demand and solid global booking trends.

Also, substantial RevPAR growth in international markets added to the upside. In the quarter, RevPAR for worldwide comparable system-wide properties increased 8.8% year over year. Also, the emphasis on expansion initiatives, digital innovation and the loyalty program bode well.

During the quarter, the company added 97 properties to its worldwide lodging portfolio. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions and high debt remain a concern. Earnings estimates for 2023 have declined in the past 30 days.

Shares ofParker-Hannifin have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - General Industrial industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +12.0%). The company is benefiting from higher demand from distributors and end users across the oil and gas, material handling, cars and light trucks, and farm and agriculture markets in the North American region within the Diversified Industrial segment.

Higher volume across all businesses, especially the commercial and military aftermarket businesses bolstered the company's Aerospace Systems unit. Synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) are also aiding the company. Benefits from the Win strategy are driving Parker-Hannifin's margins. The company's measures to add shareholder value hold promise.

However, the escalating cost of sales and rising selling, general and administrative expenses pose a threat to its bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds may dent PH's top line. A weak liquidity position is also worrisome.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

4219.0,2021-09-09 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines Giving Free Access To Live Sports To Customers,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-giving-free-access-to-live-sports-to-customers-2021-09-09,,,"(RTTNews) - American Airlines is bringing live TV football experience to its customers starting Thursday, September 9. During the football season, the customers traveling on any of American's domestic narrowbody aircraft will have free access to live sports and news networks 24/7 for every game day.
The move is aimed to attract more travelers to the airline, which sees weak capacity and revenues in its current trading, compared to pre-pandemic 2019.
With the latest offering, the airline expects college and professional football fans to be able to follow the game despite being on flight.
American claims to be providing the fastest Wi-Fi on more aircraft than any other carrier, and customers can access inflight entertainment on their personal device and connect to the ""AA-Inflight"" signal. Once connected, customers will be redirected to aainflight.com, American's Wi-Fi and entertainment portal.
The company noted that it was the first to offer free music streaming and a Lifestyle inflight entertainment channel that includes e-learning tools such as Rosetta Stone and Skillshare.
The members of the AAdvantage loyalty program can enjoy exclusive promotions and earn miles both in flight and on the ground doing everyday things, like celebration throughout football season.
The various ways to earn miles or redeem them this season and beyond include shopping for tailgate and sports gear from popular stores like Fanatics, Bass Pro Shops and Dick's Sporting Goods; scoring tickets through Vivid Seats Currently; and order carryout from selected restaurants.
If the customer is traveling to the big game now until October 31, they can earn miles on the way and when they arrive.
American added that it brought in a professional football legend to create a social media video to help bring life to an inflight entertainment brainstorm.
In July, while reporting a profit in its second quarter compared to last year's hefty loss, American said it expects its third-quarter total revenue to be down approximately 20 percent from the pre-pandemic 2019, and capacity to be down around 15 percent to 20 percent compared to that of 2019.
American recently has said it would not serve alcohol in the main cabin of its flights until January 18 next year, which is when the U.S mandate on masks in public transportation will expire.

1425.0,2013-02-20 00:00:00 UTC,The Best Stock for the Comeback Commodity of 2013,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-stock-comeback-commodity-2013-2013-02-20,,,"Although gold prices have taken a big hit of late and may be at the onset of a major pullback, there's one metal that's only recently started to rebound and is taking somestocks with it -- aluminum.
Since August of last year, aluminum prices have rallied from a multi-year low of 82 cents a pound to the current price of 96 cents a pound. Some say the shape of aluminum's price chart suggest a breakout is imminent, while others say the breakout is already underway.
Either way, with aluminum prices on the mend, companies like Alcoa ( AA ) and Century Aluminum (Nasdaq: CENX) are finding it's easier to turn aprofit . If aluminum prices continue their march toward higher levels, then these companies may post far wider profits this year than anyone is expecting, making aluminum stocks a potential Cinderella story for 2013.
A picture is worth a thousand words
The past couple of years haven't been good for the aluminum industry. After aluminum prices peaked around a two-year high of $1.35 a pound in early 2011 and began to fall to that late-2012 low of 82 cents a pound, aluminum companies commensurately suffered. For example, Alcoa's per-share profit plunged from 72 cents in 2011 to only 24 cents per share in 2012. Noranda Aluminum Holding ( NOR ) watched itsbottom line slump from $1.05 a share in 2011 to 2 cents a share in 2012.
Some other companies were entirely unprofitable ventures during this same period.
The shape of aluminum's price chart, however, suggests the aluminum industry is poised for a strong 2013.
For starters, aluminum prices have at the very least stabilized. The current price of 96 cents a pound is the same prices the metal was treading at in early January as well as in September 2012.
Aluminum is going through more than just a price stabilization though. The falling trend lines have been breached. We've seen a series of higher lows that have formed the bottom side of a triangle, or a wedge. We've seenbullish crosses of aluminum's key moving averages. It all points to an undeniable budding uptrend from the metal, whether the pros think it should be happening or not.
Who wins?
There are a handful of well-known companies set to take advantage of aluminum's rebound, including Century Aluminum, Noranda, Alcoa, Aluminum Corp. of China ( ACH ) , Alumina ( AWC ) , and Kaiser Aluminum (Nasdaq: KALU) .Currency tension between China and the United States, however, may be enough of a reason to steer clear of Aluminum Corp. of China. Alumina may be best left avoided as well, as it's an Australian company with heavy Chinese ownership that could bring an unnecessary element of risk to the table.
This leaves Kaiser Aluminum, Century Aluminum, Alcoa and Noranda.
Industry icon Alcoa is the easy and well-knownstock to own. Aside from the fact that it's a well-known company, its size makes it most likely tocapitalize oneconomies of scale . Yet, despite years of cost cuts, Alcoa is still contending with excessive expenses. The company's expenses were down 12% in the fourth quarter 2012, but it made little difference in terms of measurableearnings progress. Perhaps Alcoa's size is still more of aliability than anasset at this point.
So it's the smaller aluminum stocks -- Kaiser, Noranda and Century Aluminum -- that have quietly overcome the problems of their small size to bring real value to the table.
Kaiser seems merely average on the surface. Thedividend yield is only about 2%, and though itsnet profit margin of 6.1% is better than Alcoa's 0.8% and Noranda's typical 5%, it's still only a mediocre number. But Kaiser is on a growth binge. Sales were up 20% in 2011 and 4.5% in 2012, despite last year's 20% plunge in aluminum prices.
Noranda is certainly a bargain at almost six times trailing earnings and 10 times its forward-looking income. What really separates Noranda from the rest of the industry, however, is itsvertical integration -- Noranda supplies a great deal of its own raw aluminum, giving it tremendous control of its input expenses.
Finally, there's Century Aluminum, which isn't a bad company. Though it's not been profitable on a trailingbasis , it's expected to swing to a profit of 20 cents per share this year. Still, it's important to listen to theanalysts about this stock though. CRT Capital downgraded the stock in early January and Goldman did the same late in the month.
Risks to Consider: While a global economic malaise isn't good for any company, the real key to earnings beats from aluminum stocks this year is the metal's continued price increase. If aluminum prices slump, then these stocks would be dragged lower no matter what's going on with theeconomy .
Action to Take --> Among the six possible ways to play an aluminum rebound, my top pick is -- surprise -- Kaiser. It's the only one of the top four options that's really demonstrated it can consistently manage expenses yet still facilitate growth. In addition to the recent 20% increase in itsdividend , Kaiser Aluminum is the only one poised to lead the group out of its rut with what could be a 20% (perhaps more)upside by the end of the year.

The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) today is up +0.04%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is up +0.21%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is up +0.11%.
Stocks this morning are slightly higher.  Lower T-note yields and a decline in inflation expectations support stocks today.  The 10-year U.S. breakeven inflation rate fell to a 3-1/2 week low today at 2.308%. The markets are awaiting this afternoon’s release of the minutes of the July 25-26 FOMC meeting for clues as to the future direction of Fed policy.  This morning’s U.S. economic news was mixed as July housing starts and Jul manufacturing production rose more than expected, but July building permits rose less than expected.
China’s economic woes continue to weigh on global markets. The yuan fell to a 9-1/4 month low today, and the Shanghai Composite closed down -0.82% after China’s July home sales fell for the second month by the most in 7 months.  Also, liquidity concerns in China’s shadow banking system have intensified after Zhongrong International Trust missed payments on dozens of its investment products. 
JPMorgan Chase cut its China 2023 GDP forecast to 4.8% from a 6.4% estimate in May.  Barclays cut its China 2023 GDP forecast to 4.5% from a prior forecast of 4.9%.
Zhongrong International Trust, China's ninth-biggest trust with about 600 billion yuan in assets, missed payments on 30 investment products and halted redemptions on some short-term instruments.  The firm said liquidity has dried up ""unexpectedly,"" making it hard to meet short-term debt obligations as most of the underlying assets are long-term and illiquid.  The firm has 270 high-yield products totaling 39.5 billion yuan ($5.4 billion) due this year.
Weekly data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed mortgage applications fell -0.8% w/w, the fifth straight week of declines.  The U.S. 30-year mortgage rate rose to 7.16% last week, matching the highest since 2001.
U.S. Jul housing starts rose +3.9% m/m to 1.452 million, stronger than expectations of 1.450 million.  However, Jul building permits, a proxy for future construction, rose +0.1% m/m to 1.442 million, weaker than expectations of 1.463 million.
U.S. Jul manufacturing production unexpectedly rose +0.5% m/m, stronger than expectations of no change.
The markets are discounting the odds at 11% for a +25 bp rate hike at the September 20 FOMC meeting and 38% for that +25 bp rate hike at the November 1 FOMC meeting.

Silver prices are finding support on signs of strength in industrial metals demand after today’s news showed Eurozone Jun industrial production and U.S. Jul manufacturing production rose more than expected. 
Gains in silver were limited after JPMorgan Chase and Barclays cut their China 2023 GDP estimates, a bearish factor for industrial metals demand.  Also, fund liquidation in gold continues after long gold holdings in ETFs fell to a 3-1/3 year low on Tuesday.

3277.0,2022-09-06 00:00:00 UTC,United Airlines threatens to drop JFK service if U.S. does not approve more flights,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/united-airlines-threatens-to-drop-jfk-service-if-u.s.-does-not-approve-more-flights-0,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - United Airlines UAL.O said on Tuesday it plans to end service in October to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) if the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does not grant the air carrier additional flights.
United Chief Executive Scott Kirby wrote to Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen last week to urge him to increase capacity at JFK, according to an email Tuesday by the airline to employees that was seen by Reuters.
United is flying just twice daily to San Francisco and Los Angeles from JFK, the busiest New York-area airport, after resuming service in 2021.
""If we are not able to get additional allocations for multiple seasons, we will need to suspend service at JFK, effective at the end of October,"" United's email said.
The FAA said in a statement Tuesday it ""must consider airspace capacity and runway capacity to assess how changes would affect flights at nearby airports. Any additional slots at JFK would follow the FAA's well-established process of awarding them fairly and to increase competition.""
United said it had been working to pursue additional slots - which are takeoff and landing authorizations - through the FAA and market at JFK ""so that we can grow to be more competitive"" and said without permanent slots it cannot serve JFK ""effectively compared to the larger schedules and more attractive flight times flown by our competitors"" like JetBlue Airways JBLU.O and American Airlines AAL.O.
United in 2015 struck a long-term deal to lease 24 year-round slots at JFK to Delta Air Lines DAL.N as it ended JFK service to concentrate at its nearby Newark hub in northern New Jersey.
United argues there is room to grow at JFK, the 13th-busiest U.S. airport, because the FAA and the Port Authority since 2008 have made significant infrastructure investments including ""the widening of runways, construction of multi-entrance taxiways, and the creation of aligned high-speed turnoffs.""
In June, the FAA approved United's request to temporarily cut about 50 daily summer departures from its Newark airport hub to address congestion, representing 12% of United's 425 daily flights at Newark. United is the dominant carrier at Newark, operating 69% of flights.

1130.0,2020-08-06 00:00:00 UTC,"Trump reimposes tariffs on raw Canadian aluminum, says needs to defend U.S. industry",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trump-reimposes-tariffs-on-raw-canadian-aluminum-says-needs-to-defend-u.s.-industry-2020,,,"By Jeff Mason
CLYDE, Ohio, Aug 6 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday moved to reimpose 10% tariffs on some Canadian aluminum products to protect U.S. industry from a ""surge"" in imports, angering Ottawa and some U.S. business groups.
During a wide-ranging speech at a Whirlpool Corp WHR.N washing machine factory in Ohio to tout his ""America First"" trade agenda, Trump said he signed a proclamation reimposing the ""Section 232"" national security tariffs. The step was ""absolutely necessary to defend our aluminum industry,"" he said.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office said the 10% tariffs apply to raw, un-alloyed aluminum produced at smelters. The tariffs do not apply to downstream aluminum products.
""Several months ago, my administration agreed to lift those tariffs in return for a promise from the Canadian government that its aluminum industry would not flood our country with exports and kill all our aluminum jobs, which is exactly what they've done,"" Trump said. ""Canadian aluminum producers have broken their commitment.""
Canada has a natural advantage in primary aluminum production because of its ample supply of cheap hydroelectric power.
A Canadian government source said Canada will respond by slapping retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.
Canada imposed similar tariffs on U.S. goods from bourbon to ketchup when Trump first imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico in March 2018.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce called the move ""a step in the wrong direction"" that would raise costs on U.S. companies and consumers.
But Michael Bless, chief executive of Century Aluminum CENX.O, one of the few remaining U.S. primary aluminum smalting companies and which lobbied for bringing back the tariffs, said the move ""helps to secure continued domestic production of this vital strategic material and level the playing field for thousands of American aluminum workers.""

1023.0,2021-06-23 00:00:00 UTC,Why Falling Homebuilder Stocks Look Like a Buy,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-falling-homebuilder-stocks-look-like-a-buy-2021-06-23,,,"I
n his testimony to Congress yesterday, Fed Chair Jay Powell stood up to politicians from both sides of the aisle. There was a lot of pressure from Republicans to say that 1970s style hyperinflation was coming but Powell refused to say so. Rather, he said that scenario was “very, very unlikely.” Powell also did not yield to pressures from Democrats, who seemingly wanted him to say that increasing government debt to hand out cash and boosting the already high government spending has had no inflationary effect. He did admit in his prepared remarks that inflation was here to stay in the short-term. However, his comments suggested that the Federal Reserve was not going to be panicked into hiking rates any time soon.
From an investor’s perspective, this means that two seemingly contradictory statements can be true. As I wrote yesterday, companies that benefit from short-term inflationary pressures, such as Alcoa (AA), have a good short-to-medium-term outlook. But, at the same time, the selloff activity related to interest rate hikes can be seen as premature and overdone. As long as the Fed believes in what Powell stated, which is that this is just a temporary phenomenon, prices can continue to rise, and rates will stay low.
There are a couple of stocks that have been sold as if a rate hike is expected any day, creating some great value for bargain hunters.
Take, for example, homebuilders such as KB Homes (KBH) and Beazer (BZH). Both stocks are down significantly from their highs around a month ago, even though the housing market has been booming. The Case-Schiller national house price index is rising at an annual rate of 13% and currently, there are many cases where housing buyers have to beat out many competitors. For example, my son recently had to beat out 47 other buyers to purchase a house in the Dallas area. And yet, stocks have been sold off, resulting in charts that look like this going back to early May: 
I guess this would make sense if the high demand and rapidly rising prices for products had led to sky-high P/Es, but that is absolutely not the case. Right now, KB Homes has trailing and forward P/Es of 12 and 7.6, respectively, and Beazer is even cheaper at 8 and 3.5. Obviously, valuation isn’t the issue, and nor is liquidity. Both companies have decent balance sheets and strong free cash flow. So, the only explanation for the 15% to 20% declines in the stock prices is the belief that something will happen that will negatively impact demand, perhaps something like a rate hike. 
There are two points to be made here. The first is that Jay Powell’s testimony yesterday, combined with the statement following the most recent FOMC meeting, make that look unlikely. The second is that, even if it were to happen, mortgages would still be cheap as wages start to increase. A 25-basis point hike of the Federal Funds Rate may change the tone, but the immediate practical impact on home buyers will be limited. One could even argue that a policy reversal with the prospect of further rate increases would motivate even more homebuyers to make the move now. 
All in all, with input costs for homebuilders steadying as commodity and lumber prices retrace, along with no imminent rate hike and a continued high demand, the short and medium term prospects for homebuilders look good. This means stocks like KBH and BZH are too cheap and their recent selloffs are an opportunity for investors, not a warning.

GABORONE, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Botswana is conducting due diligence on HB Antwerp, as the world's top diamond producing country by value seeks to finalise a deal to acquire a 24% shareholding in the Belgian gem trader, President Mokgweetsi Masisi said on Monday.
At the height of talks for a new sales contract with De Beers in March, Botswana announced a deal to become a shareholder in HB Antwerp and to supply the trader with 10% of the rough diamond output from the state-owned Okavango Diamond Company (ODC) for five years.
But the proposed deal was called into question in September when Lucara Diamond LUC.TOterminated its sales agreement with the Belgian gem trader, citing financial irregularities. HB and Lucara first entered into a diamond sales agreement in 2020, which was extended for 10 years in 2022.
“Due process of detailed legal and commercial due diligence is now ongoing to finalise the deal,” Masisi said on Monday during a state of the nation address.
After Lucara cut ties with HB Antwerp in September, Masisi told a media briefing the country would reassess the proposed deal to determine its next course of action.
Masisi has said the deal with HB Antwerp gives Botswana a foothold in the diamond downstream industry.
""HB was giving us an opportunity that we never got from our partner De Beers and that’s why we were willing to take the risk with a 10% allocation of ODC supply,” Masisi said in September.
Botswana and Anglo American AAL.L unit De Beers in June agreed a ten-year diamond sales agreement, which will see ODC's share of Debswana output rise to 30% from 25% previously, rising to 40% in five years' time and eventually 50% by the end of the contract.

Mining is a key source of tax revenue for Peru, the world's No. 2 copper producer. Miners have benefited this year from higher prices and a weak local currency, which boosted their revenue and increased their tax bills due to exports sold in dollars.
The National Society of Mining, Oil and Energy said in a statement that miners paid 4 billion soles in taxes in 2020, when output was hit by pandemic restrictions, and about 4.8 billion soles in 2019.
The group - whose members include Compania de Minas Buenaventura BUEv.LM and subsidiaries of Anglo American AAL.L, Hudbay Minerals HBM.TO, Southern Copper Corp SCCO.N and Barrick Gold Corp ABX.TO - also forecasts that the mining sector will pay 17 billion soles in taxes on average each year from 2022 through 2026.
It said this was higher than in any other five-year period.
Peru is under a new left-wing government led by President Pedro Castillo, an elementary school teacher, who is seeking to extract higher taxes from the mining sector but has not yet made any concrete proposal on the issue.
Neighbor Chile, the world's top copper producer, is also discussing higher taxes for miners in Congress.
The mining industry group said in its statement that the current Peruvian tax system was ""considered a good regime by international and national experts.""
Peru's economy ministry said overall tax revenue in Peru will rise 24% in 2021 compared with a year earlier, and a further 8% in 2022, according to preliminary estimates.

2683.0,2023-04-17 00:00:00 UTC,PREVIEW-Big copper deals to take centerstage in Santiago as demand heats up,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-big-copper-deals-to-take-centerstage-in-santiago-as-demand-heats-up-0,,,"Repeats April 16 story with no changes
SANTIAGO, April 16 (Reuters) - Global copper producers are converging in Chile this week for their largest gathering since 2019, with talks expected to center on the industry's growing M&A wave amid surging demand and tight supply for the metal anchoring the green energy transition.
The buyout trend comes as Indigenous groups, host communities and others increasingly oppose the industry's attempts to build new mines, obstacles fueling the growing realization among mining companies that they may need to combine in order to grow.
Glencore Plc GLEN.L last month offered $22.5 billion to buy smaller rival Teck Resources Ltd TECKb.TO, an offer that Teck has so far rejected in favor of its own copper-focused growth plans. Lundin Mining Corp LUN.TO is paying nearly $1 billion for control of Chile's Caserones copper mine despite ongoing political uncertainty in the country.
Leaders from all three companies are slated to be among the roughly 450 investors, executives, analysts and regulators gathering in the Chilean capital of Santiago for the annual World Copper Conference.
Registrations are up roughly 8% since 2019 when the conference was last held fully in person. Organizers say they expect the attendance to grow as the week progresses.
""The green transformation theme remains a strong tailwind for copper, the king of green metals,"" Saxo Bank strategist Ole Hansen told Reuters. ""Not least considering how producers face challenges in the years ahead with lower ore grades, rising production costs and lack of investments in recent years.""
Global copper demand expected to reach 53 million tonnes annually by 2053 - more than double current levels - but supply is still expected to fall short, according an S&P Global SPGI.N study. That projection in part underscores the deal rush.
BHP Group Ltd BHP.AX, the world's largest mining company, last week won shareholder approval for its $6.4 billion takeover of Australian copper producer Oz Minerals Ltd OZL.AX.
Rio Tinto Ltd RIO.AX, which faces strong opposition to its Resolution Copper project in Arizona, last December paid $3.3 billion to buy rival Turquoise Hill and gain direct control over a giant Mongolian copper mine.
And Hudbay Minerals Inc HBM.TO last week said it would pay $439 million for rival Copper Mountain Mining Corp CMMC.TO.
Beyond M&A, these mining giants face the creeping problem of attracting new workers, especially in the United States, as well as competition from upstart rivals exploring new ways to extract copper at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and through leaching of mine waste.
""This is a fairly agile market and it is permanently evaluating its long-term investments,"" Chilean Mining Minister Marcela Hernando told Reuters.
Hernando, slated to deliver the conference's keynote speech on Tuesday, expects copper output to jump in coming years from her country, the world's top producer, thanks to operations from state-owned Codelco, BHP, Anglo American Plc AAL.L, Freeport-McMoRan Inc FCX.N, Glencore and Teck.
Neighboring Peru, the world's second-largest copper producer, also expects to boost production this year.
Copper prices CMCu3 touched a seven-week high last Friday despite macroeconomic concerns fueled by uncertain Chinese demand projections and the ongoing war in Ukraine, although they are down nearly 5% from a seven-month high of $9,550.50 reached in January.
""We expect the copper market to remain in deficit as the green transition accelerates,"" Fitch Solutions said in a recent report to clients.
A portion of the weeklong conference is devoted to research presentations on new applications for the red metal, part of an industry plan to go on the offense against aluminum, a cheaper but less-efficient alternative to conduct electricity.

Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) is due to issue its quarterly earnings report after the close today. Given its history, traders can expect very active trading in the upcoming After-hours session immediately following the company's release of its quarterly earnings. An analysis of historical premarket and after-hours trading activity and liquidity conditions in AA following an earnings release indicates that the price change in the extended hours is likely to be of significant value in forecasting additional price movement in the following regular session.
Analysts at MidnightTrader have tracked how AA's stock price has reacted to quarterly earnings events the past both in the after-hours and following regular session. The result of that study is below.
Over the last year, when shares of AA rose in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, there is limited evidence to suggest a follow-through in the same direction the next day.
Over the last year, when shares of AA dropped in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, there is limited evidence to suggest a follow-through in the same direction the next day.
Our analysis of over a decade of company specific earnings related news and price data on over 5,000 US companies demonstrates that earnings event related trading opportunities can exist for those trading in the after-hours and premarket sessions. Certain stocks demonstrate a historical tendency to either underprice or overreact to earnings news in the extended-hours (the time when companies typically release earnings) relative to the following regular session close.

1849.0,2010-09-02 00:00:00 UTC,Investors May Get Their Chance to Go Long,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investors-may-get-their-chance-go-long-2010-09-02,,,"The summer may be ending, but the volatility continued yesterday, as stocks extended the big gains made on Wednesday. And a late afternoon rally took prices to the high of the day almost at the final bell.
Economic reports seemed to be the reason for the rally. Initial jobless claims for the week ended Aug. 28 came in at 472,000 versus an expected 475,000, and continuing claims fell to 4.46 million from 4.48 million. Productivity in Q2 fell 1.8%, which is close to the prediction of 1.7%, and unit labor costs increased 1.1% as expected. But pending home sales resulted in a surprise - up 5.2% for the month where analysts had expected no change. Factory orders for July increased 0.1% versus an expected 0.3%.
Retail stocks enjoyed a strong session, climbing 2.2% following a report of strong back-to-school sales for August. Consumer discretionary stocks gained 1.8%, and industrials were up 1.2%.
Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA ) led the 30 Dow stocks, up 2.85%, followed by The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE: HD ), up 2.58%, and The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA ), up 2.1%.
The euro rose slightly versus the dollar, and Treasuries fell again, bringing the 10-year note to a yield of 2.627%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 51 points, closing at 10,320, the S&P 500 rose 10 points, closing at 1,090, and the Nasdaq gained 23 points at 2,200.
The NYSE traded 960 million shares with advancers ahead of decliners by 2.5-to-1. On the Nasdaq, advancers were ahead by 1.7-to-1 on volume of 463 million shares.
Crude oil for October delivery rose $1.11 to $75.02 a barrel, and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE ) closed at $53.55, up 44 cents.
September gold gained $5.20, closing at $1,251.50 an ounce, and the PHLX Gold/Silver Sector Index (NASDAQ: XAU ) gained 2.15 points, closing at 186.41.
What the Markets Are Saying
In just two days stocks have miraculously revived and vaulted to regain almost half of the losses of the entire month of August. And the S&P 500 sprang from the support zone at 1,040 to 1,055 following daily reversals and buy signals from our in-house indicator, the Collins-Bollinger Reversal (CBR).
Thursday's Daily Market Outlook gave several levels of the S&P as targets for the reversal: Fibonacci numbers: 50% = 1,084, 61.8%=1,095, and then the 200-day moving average at 1,115.
And, of course, there is the psychological resistance line at 1,100, which may turn out to be the first stop for this rally. Not only is 1,100 touted by the press as a barrier, but on eight days this year it has halted short-term rallies, and in every case the failure to penetrate 1,100 led to a reversal and a test of support back to the 1,040 - 1,055 support zone. This is not solid enough evidence to ""bet the farm"" on a reversal down from 1,100, but we should closely observe the tape action of the S&P 500 and be alert to the possibility of a reversal if it nears that mark.
Today is Friday, and that means a review of the sentiment indicators. Last week, the AAII bulls were at the lowest percent (20.74%) since July 7 at S&P 1,028. And July 7 marked the beginning of a five-week rally that took the S&P 500 to the top at 1,129 on Aug. 9.
This week another of the important sentiment indicators, the Investors Intelligence Advisors Sentiment, showed a drop of bulls for the third consecutive week. They were 29.4% versus 33.3% a week ago, and 41.7% at the start of August. Both the AAII and the Investors Intelligence reports are reverse indicators - a drop in sentiment for both is bullish for the markets. And the markets appropriately responded.
A very fine technician, Sam Turner, of RiverFront Investment Group, produced a study that appears to indicate that if the current rally follows the course of the two major reversals this year, the slope of the resulting uptrends is important. He concludes that we should see a multi-week rally and the now familiar resistance at 1,130 should again come into play by the end of September.
Well, it's a long time between now and the end of September, but we should keep the target in mind. Between now and 1,130 there could be many opportunities to pick up long positions since the two prior bounces from 1,040 had many detours - one of which took us not to 1,040, but to the low of the year at 1,011.
We will not be publishing the Daily Market Outlook on Monday, but next week I will continue our discussion of forming a clearly defined trading plan. Have a happy and safe holiday.

July 12 (Reuters) - American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O expects to report its first pretax quarterly profit since the onset of the pandemic as booming travel demand helps it offset mounting costs, the carrier said on Tuesday.
Major U.S. airlines are poised to post their strongest earnings starting Wednesday, helped by a surge in bookings driven by pent-up demand even as they grapple with higher jet fuel costs and labor shortages.
The carrier expects total revenue per available seat mile to be up about 22.5% amid a lower-than-planned capacity, as its pricing power gains momentum.
""American Airlines' overall guidance looks modestly positive, with revenue stronger than expected, even though ex-fuel seat mile cost and jet fuel kerosene expense pressure look a little worse than expected,"" said Citi analyst Stephen Trent
The Fort Worth, Texas-based company expects fuel expenses to average between $4.00 and $4.05 per gallon compared with its previous forecast of $3.92 to $3.97 per gallon.
Revenue in the quarter is expected to rise by about 12% to 13.39 billion from the same period in 2019. The company had earlier forecast second-quarter revenue between 11% and 13%.
The carrier expects to earn a pre-tax income of $585 million in the quarter.

3809.0,2022-02-03 00:00:00 UTC,PREVIEW-Big miners plug into battery metals joint ventures,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-big-miners-plug-into-battery-metals-joint-ventures,,,"By Clara Denina and Zandi Shabalala
LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Big miners, under pressure to increase their exposure to minerals needed to drive the electric vehicle revolution, have so far opted for the cautious approach of joint ventures with small explorers rather than buying them outright.
Shareholders will scrutinise quarterly results and statements in this month's earning season for news on battery metals such as copper, nickel, cobalt and lithium, used in batteries and renewable energy.
But the miners will also be keen to retain the loyalty of shareholders they have lured with dividends and buybacks to a high-risk sector that remembers reckless spending in previous commodity booms that were followed by bust.
Joint ventures, rather than outright acquisitions, have the advantage of spreading the risks associated with complex minerals that may not provide the margins of the traditional bulk commodities.
As the trend gathered pace, the world's largest listed BHP Group BHP.AX, BHPB.L this month said it had spent $40 million to advance a nickel project in Tanzania through UK-based private developer Kabanga Nickel. The deal also marks its re-entry into Africa.
Such joint ventures can give miners more geographical reach without full exposure to jurisdictions seen as politically challenging.
Over recent years, world number two miner Rio Tinto RIO.AX, RIO.L has been exploring for copper on Canada-listed junior Midnight Sun's MMA.V licences in Zambia under a joint venture agreement and Anglo American AAL.L has been in discussion with Zambian-focused junior Arc Minerals ARCMA.L to hunt for copper.
""We expect the diversified miners to enter new geographies in 2022 through the acquisition of early-stage projects,"" said James Whiteside, research director at consultancy WoodMac.
But the consultancy predicts large acquisitions this year will remain constrained by a reluctance to buy at high commodity prices that will leave investment growth across metals and mining at multi-year lows.
BHP's exploration budget for the first half of this year is just $80 million.
That could be a problem for ensuring sufficient battery minerals to meet the expected surge in demand.
In the venture deals, the big miners help with providing for equipment and labour skills, while the assets are mainly run by the smaller exploring company.
""The problem is you need extra supply and ...it's going to need more than M&A,"" Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, said.
Bank of America head of metals research Michael Widmer also said investments in battery metals markets by major miners will not rival spending and profits of established markets such as iron ore, where high margins are far easier to deliver.
""The reality is that for the big mining companies investment in smaller miners doesn't move the needle that much, but it's good to show that they are in the battery metals,"" he said.

The request included arms, ammunition and intelligence, but US President Barack Obama has been firm in his decision not to get involved militarily. Instead, the administration has agreed only to send military rations.
On Thursday, Russia sent troops to perform military exercises near the border of Ukraine as well as dispatching six fighter jets and three transport planes to Belarus to patrol the area. The move intensified the already tense situation and will likely push the US and Europe to enact economic sanctions in an effort to stop Moscow.
Top News
In other news around the markets:
On Thursday, General Electric announced that it is planning to sell a part of its credit card unit. The company will hold an IPO for the new company, set to be called Synchrony Financial. Some analysts have estimated the company's value at up to $20 billion, but GE has given no indication of its exact value. The search effort for a Malaysia Airlines jet destined for Beijing shifted hundreds of miles west after it was discovered that the plane had been transmitting its location to satellites for nearly five hours after it disappeared from radar. Experts say the final transmission was sent over water at a normal cruising altitude and that it is unclear why the transmissions stopped. Things got worse for General Motors on Thursday night after a safety watchdog group released a study showing that 303 deaths were linked to airbag deployment failures in 1.6 million GM cars which were recalled last month. As the probe into the company's handling of the defect continues, GM is facing more and more pressure to compensate victims. Amazon is planning a 25 percent price increase for Prime members set to come into effect as early as next week. The company will take membership prices from $79 per month to $99 per month to offset fuel and shipping cost increases. The decision is unlikely to drive away current prime users, but may deter new customers from joining.

367.0,2022-10-13 00:00:00 UTC,PayPal (PYPL) Boosts Focus on Small Businesses With Terminal,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/paypal-pypl-boosts-focus-on-small-businesses-with-terminal,,,"PayPal PYPL rolled out a digital point-of-sale solution, PayPal Zettle Terminal, in the United States to deliver an enhanced payment experience to small businesses and their customers.

Notably, Terminal is an in-store solution, which comes with a pre-loaded SIM card and Zettle point-of-sale app pre-installed. It does not require any second device to pair with and features robust Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity.

Terminal enables merchants to accept payments from customers via credit cards, digital wallets,
PayPal and Venmo QR Codes, seamlessly and securely.

It also helps businesses in sales, inventory, reporting and payments management.

We believe that all these features will aid the company in gaining solid momentum among small businesses, which, in turn, will strengthen its seller base.

The latest move is likely to boost the total number of payment transactions and total payment volume (TPV) in the days ahead.

In second-quarter 2022, PayPal’s total number of payment transactions was 5.5 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. TPV amounted to $339.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9% on a spot rate basis and 13% on a currency-neutral basis.
PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus
  PayPal Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PayPal Holdings, Inc. Quote
Growing Focus on Small Businesses
We note that the latest move bodes well for PayPal’s growing efforts toward strengthening offerings for small businesses.

Apart from the latest move, the company recently launched PayPal Business Cashback Mastercard, its business credit card backed by Mastercard and issued by WebBank, with the help of which it strives to cater to the daily financing needs of small businesses.

Expanding the global reach of PayPal Business Debit Mastercard remains noteworthy. Notably, the card, which is ideal for small businesses, does not carry any monthly fees or foreign exchange fees. The card allows users to access the funds stored in their PayPal accounts at more than 52 million Mastercard acceptance locations throughout the world.

The company offers PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loans, which are focused on catering to the needs of small businesses.

We believe that all these endeavors will boost the small merchant base of PayPal, which, in turn, will drive its top-line growth in the days ahead.
Growing Digital Payment Initiatives
The latest move is in sync with the company’s strengthening digital payment endeavors.

In addition to the latest launch, PayPal’s unveiling of a payment card, namely the PayPal Cashback credit card issued by Synchrony, remains a positive. The card allows customers to gain more rewards while shopping online and offline, and paying with PayPal.

The card offers a 3% cash back when paying with PayPal at checkout — online, mobile, or in-store with PayPal QR Code. It gives an unlimited 2% cash back on all other purchases made through Mastercard, wherever accepted.

PayPal’s partnership with United, under which PayPal QR Code was made available as a payment option for passengers on boarding flights of the latter, remains noteworthy.

We believe that all the above-mentioned efforts will continue to expand PayPal’s footprint in the booming digital payment world.

Per a report from Statista, this market is expected to generate a transaction value of $8.7 trillion in 2022, which is expected to see a CAGR of 12.8% between 2022 and 2026, and hit $14.1 trillion by 2026.

We believe that the company’s growing prospects in this promising market will help it win investor confidence in the near term.

Notably, PayPal has lost 55.5% on a year-to-date basis compared with the industry’s decline of 57.5%.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2550.0,2023-06-05 00:00:00 UTC,Delta Air Lines Stock Poised For Strong Gains?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/delta-air-lines-stock-poised-for-strong-gains,,,"Delta Air Lines stock (NYSE: DAL) currently trades at $36 per share, more than 30% below its level in April 2021, and it seems like it has the potential for sizable gains. Delta Air Lines saw its stock trading at around $29 in late June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, and is now 25% above that level. The stock has gained 30% since its low in September 2022 compared to the S&P 500, which gained about 10% during this period. The rally in the stock over recent months has been driven by a steady decline in the inflation rate in response to the Fed’s aggressive rate hike plan – although investors still have concerns about a potential recession. The notable increase in Delta Air Lines’ revenues over recent quarters has also contributed to the stock recovery.
Returning to the pre-inflation shock level means that DAL stock will have to gain more than 40% from here. We believe that this will materialize over time and estimate Delta Air Lines’ valuation to be around $50 per share, implying over 35% gains. This is because the company has seen a strong recovery in travel demand over the recent quarters, evident from its total available seat miles (ASM), which grew 18% y-o-y, and its passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) rose 27% to 16.97 cents in Q1. Furthermore, the company has expanded its operating margins from 1.4% in 2021 to 4.0% now. Our Delta Air Lines Operating Income Comparison dashboard has more details. A continued expansion of top-line and operating margin means that Delta Air Lines will see strong earnings growth in the near future. In fact, we forecast adjusted earnings to rise a significant 73% y-o-y to $5.55 in 2023.
Our detailed analysis of Delta Air Lines’ upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company’s stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022 and compares these trends to the stock’s performance during the 2008 recession.
2022 Inflation Shock
Timeline of Inflation Shock So Far:
2020 – early 2021: Increase in money supply to cushion the impact of lockdowns led to high demand for goods; producers unable to match up.
Early 2021: Shipping snarls and worker shortages from the coronavirus pandemic continue to hurt the supply
April 2021: Inflation rates cross 4% and increase rapidly
Early 2022: Energy and food prices spike due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Fed begins its rate hike process
June 2022: Inflation levels peak at 9% – the highest level in 40 years. S&P 500 index declines more than 20% from peak levels.
July – September 2022: Fed hikes interest rates aggressively – resulting in an initial recovery in the S&P 500 followed by another sharp decline
Since October 2022: Fed continues rate hike process; improving market sentiments help S&P500 recoup some of its losses.
In contrast, here’s how DAL stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.
Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis
10/1/2007: Approximate pre-crisis peak in S&P 500 index
9/1/2008 – 10/1/2008: Accelerated market decline corresponding to Lehman bankruptcy filing (9/15/08)
3/1/2009: Approximate bottoming out of S&P 500 index
12/31/2009: Initial recovery to levels before accelerated decline (around 9/1/2008)
DAL and S&P 500 Performance During 2007-08 Crisis
DAL stock declined from $18 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak) to around $5 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out), implying DAL stock lost over 70% of its pre-crisis value. It recovered post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $11 in early 2010, rising 126% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.
DAL Fundamentals Over Recent Years
DAL revenues fell sharply from $47 billion in 2019 to just $17.1 billion in 2020 as the Covid-19 outbreak hit the airline industry hard. Revenues improved gradually over 2021 before reaching $51 billion in 2022, with a recovery in travel demand. Delta Air Lines’ ASM surged 1.7x between 2020 and 2022, but it’s still below the levels seen in 2019, before the pandemic.
Despite higher revenue, reported earnings decreased from $7.32 in 2019 to $2.06 in 2022 due to higher fuel and other operating costs. DAL reported a $19.49 per share loss in 2020 when the pandemic severely impacted its financials. On an adjusted basis, earnings declined to $3.20 in 2022, vs. $7.31 in 2019.
Does DAL Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?
Delta Air Line’s total debt increased from $12 billion in 2019 to $24 billion in 2022, while its total cash increased from around $3 billion to $6 billion over the same period. However, the rise in cash balance is partly due to additional debt raised, given the $4 billion negative operating cash flows in 2020. The company garnered $6 billion in cash flows from operations in 2022. Although the company has a high debt burden, it appears to be in a comfortable position to meet its near-term obligations.
Conclusion
With the Fed’s efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiments, we believe Delta Air Lines (DAL) stock has the potential for solid gains despite the fears of a potential recession, as consumers prioritize travel spending over other areas.

2925.0,2023-02-01 00:00:00 UTC,"Biden moves to slash U.S. credit card fees, app charges",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biden-moves-to-slash-u.s.-credit-card-fees-app-charges-0,,,"By Douglas Gillison and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday was due to announce fresh efforts to slash credit card late fees and drive down the prices that Apple Inc AAPL.O and Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O charge on mobile app stores.
The move is part of a larger policy drive to promote competition in consumer markets, officials said.
President Joe Biden was also set to urge Congress to ban hidden ""junk fees"" and penalties that a federal consumer watchdog says are creeping into everyday retail services across industries, driving up consumer costs, including fees airlines charge for family members to sit next to young children, White House officials said.
Biden has been beating the drum on inflation, criticizing Republicans who now control the House of Representatives for backing tax measures that he said would benefit the wealthy at the expense of middle-class taxpayers.
Biden, who is expected to announce a bid for re-election in the coming weeks, has also been slamming Republicans for their refusal to approve an increase in the U.S. debt ceiling unless there is a deal on spending cuts.
Wednesday's announcement coincides with a scheduled meeting between Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that is likely to mark the start of protracted maneuvering on raising the $31.4 trillion borrowing cap.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will propose on Wednesday a rule to ban ""excessive"" fees that credit card issuers charge for late payments, something the bureau estimated costs consumers $12 billion a year.
""When someone misses a credit card payment, even if they paid just a day or two late, or even a few hours, they can be hit with a cascading series of fees,"" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra told reporters in a Tuesday call.
Chopra said such fees far exceeded any additional costs that lenders incurred.
The White House estimates the rule is projected to reduce typical late fees from roughly $30 to $8, saving consumers as much as $9 billion a year.
The rule could take effect in 2024 after a comment period, Chopra said. However, regulations are frequently subject to challenge and litigation by industry groups that can block or delay them.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), an arm of the Commerce Department, is also releasing a report on Wednesday denouncing the market dominance enjoyed by Apple and Google in the app economy, where the vast majority of smartphone users and developers are hemmed inside the tech giants' software ecosystems, which the NTIA said drives up costs and limits innovation.
The report calls for greater user control over which applications are available, an end to platform operators' ""self-preference"" for their own apps, and a ban on requirements that apps use the operators' in-app payments systems.
An Apple spokesperson, in a statement, said that while the report ""acknowledges the importance of user privacy, data security and user convenience,"" some of its conclusions ""ignore the investments we make in innovation, privacy and security.""
Google also disagreed with the report's findings, saying through a spokesperson that its Android system ""enables more choice and competition than any other mobile operating system.""
Meanwhile, the Transportation Department on Wednesday will propose regulations to bar airlines from charging family members to be seated next to children age 13 or younger and will disclose on a government dashboard which airlines do not charge such fees, the White House said.
Wednesday's announcements will mark the fourth meeting of Biden's Competition Council, created in 2021 when consumer inflation was at 40-year highs and was widely seen as a political headwind ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.

3347.0,2022-07-28 00:00:00 UTC,Is JetBlue Stock a Buy After Spirit Deal?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-jetblue-stock-a-buy-after-spirit-deal,,,"JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) has a deal to buy Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE), emerging victorious after a six-month bidding war against Frontier Group Holdings (NASDAQ: ULCC).
JetBlue won the battle, but now the real fight begins. Investors have every reason to be excited about the prospects of a combined JetBlue/Spirit, but it will likely take years for the deal to live up to its potential, if it ever does.
A quick connection
Frontier put Spirit in play back in February, announcing a cash-and-stock deal that would have created the nation's fifth-largest carrier. JetBlue came forward with a rival, higher, bid a month later, but Spirit's board remained loyal to Frontier in part due to fears that antitrust authorities would quash any JetBlue merger effort.
JetBlue remained steadfast in its offer, and its persistence paid off. On Wednesday, Spirit and Frontier announced they were terminating their agreement after Spirit failed to win shareholder support for the deal.
It took less than 24 hours for JetBlue to secure a deal. Terms of the deal call for JetBlue to pay $33.50 per share in cash for Spirit, including a prepayment of $2.50 per share payable once Spirit shareholders sign off on the deal. To address regulatory concerns JetBlue has also agreed to pay a $0.10-per-month ""ticking fee"" starting in January until the deal closes, and a $400 million breakup fee if the merger is rejected.
A chance to ""turbocharge"" growth
For both Frontier and JetBlue, buying Spirit was a unique opportunity to springboard growth in a difficult operating environment. Airlines have seen demand rebound from pandemic lows, but a shortage of pilots and planes has put a cap on organic growth.
Smaller carriers like JetBlue have been hit harder by the pilot shortage because they tend to pay less than larger rivals like Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) or United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), meaning those titans can poach pilots to fill their own needs
Buying Spirit would give JetBlue a much larger pilot roster, and a huge order book of new jets. The combination would have more than 1,700 daily flights to more than 125 destinations in 30 countries, with a fleet of 458 aircraft and more than 300 Airbus (OTC: EADSY) jets on order.
""We are excited to deliver this compelling combination that turbocharges our strategic growth, enabling JetBlue to bring our unique blend of low fares and exceptional service to more customers, on more routes,"" JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes said in a statement. ""This combination is an exciting opportunity to diversify and expand our network, add jobs and new possibilities for crew members, and expand our platform for profitable growth.""
Not an easy sell to regulators
For Hayes to gain control of Spirit, he will have to convince a skeptical audience in Washington that the deal is pro-consumer. Spirit's board was not incorrect in its original conclusion that JetBlue likely will face an uphill battle winning over regulators.
Spirit, like Frontier, operates an ""ultra-low-cost"" model that offers low base fares but charges for extras that other airlines include in their fares. JetBlue has always been more of a hybrid, selling a premium experience at a somewhat higher price. JetBlue has said it intends to shift Spirit's operations to its model, which would mean removing seats from Spirit planes and reconfiguring the cabins to provide more premium seating.
Fewer discounted seats would likely mean higher prices, a sticking point for regulators. JetBlue and Spirit also both primarily fly around the East Coast and the Caribbean, meaning more overlap and the elimination of a competitor on a lot of routes.
JetBlue is already in the regulatory crosshairs due to its close partnership with American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL). The Department of Justice has voiced concerns about an arrangement that allows the two airlines to coordinate operations in the U.S. Northeast, and is unlikely to look favorably on JetBlue's bid to consolidate the industry.
JetBlue has offered to divest gates at crowded airports to appease regulators, but has shown no indication it is willing to give up the American partnership.
JetBlue shareholders need to buckle up
Spirit shares are up on the JetBlue deal, but still trade at a 25% discount to JetBlue's offer price. That wide gap indicates how skeptical the markets are that JetBlue will actually close the deal.
The caution is justified. At best, JetBlue investors are facing a bruising Capitol Hill battle that is likely to drag on for months, after which JetBlue would face a long and costly integration to bring Spirit up to its standards. Airlines historically have struggled to merge union seniority lists following a merger, and almost inevitably resolve issues with pay raises and other perks.
At worst, JetBlue's management will be distracted for months, pay out some cash to Spirit shareholders, but not be able to close the merger. Management already has a lot to deal with even without that distraction, with fuel costs soaring and the prospect of softening demand due to inflation and the threat of a recession.
There's great potential in the JetBlue/Spirit deal, but given the risks and the extended timetable there is no reason for investors to buy in right now.

3604.0,2022-04-21 00:00:00 UTC,"American Airlines Wins Earnings, Projects Big Growth",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-wins-earnings-projects-big-growth,,,"Give American Airlines (AAL) credit for its sheer optimism. The company posted its earnings report, which featured wins, at least of a sort. However, the biggest wins came about as a result of American's impressive projections going forward.
The company encouraged shareholders to brace for what should be the “record of all revenues,” and American shot up 10.5% in premarket trading on Thursday as a result.
Those gains held into Thursday's trading, but I'm turning bearish on American Airlines. When a company advances on smaller than expected losses, I get concerned. Follow that up with a rosy but largely unsupportable thesis about future growth, and I get worried.
Looking at the last 12 months in share prices for American Airlines reminds me of a flight I wouldn't want to be on. The company ended last April on an upward note, but then promptly started a decline.
The company pulled out of its tailspin on at least eight separate occasions. It generally lost ground shortly thereafter, ending the last 12 months down from what it was this time last year.
The latest news seems to be helping, but for how long? The company's earnings report featured a win for both earnings and revenue. The company turned in a loss of $2.32 per share. Refinitiv analysts were expecting a loss of $2.40 per share. Revenue was an outright win at $8.9 billion against projections of $8.8 billion.
Wall Street's Take
Turning to Wall Street, American Airlines has a Moderate Sell consensus rating. That's based on eight Holds and four Sells assigned in the past three months. The average American Airlines price target of $15.41 implies 24.3% downside potential.
Analyst price targets range from a low of $8 per share to a high of $19 per share.
Investor Support Proves Mixed for American
Investor support, meanwhile, is proving a mixed bag.
One of the biggest bear cases for American Airlines right now is hedge fund involvement. The TipRanks 13-F Tracker reveals that hedge funds lowered their involvement by 2.2 million shares last quarter.
American enjoyed a modest uptick in hedge fund involvement between June and September 2021. However, between September and December 2021, the hedge funds pulled back once more.
Insider trading, meanwhile, was fairly brisk. Though lately, sellers are ahead of buyers, the longer-term picture puts the two forces about even. In the last year, buyers led sellers 20 to 13. However, in the last six months, sellers led buyers 13 to nine.
Retail investors, however, are increasingly in on American Airlines. The amount of portfolios holding American shares is up 5.9% in the last 30 days.
Recovery Narrative Doesn't Fly Here
I've never been particularly happy about the notion of a company's stock gaining ground because it posted a smaller loss than expected. Yes, it's a win, but only a win in the technical sense. The company still lost a massive amount of money.
The macroeconomic environment doesn't look good for American Airlines overall, either. It was counting on business travel to return. It's been showing signs of doing that, certainly. With a recession looming in the background, how much longer will that continue?
The same case carries on to individual travelers. Inflation is currently eating disposable income's lunch. Thus, why would travelers hop a flight to anywhere as opposed to staying home and at least somewhat saving money?
Bacardi just filed a lawsuit against American Airlines. Allegedly, the airline failed to deliver several thousand bottles of cognac to Los Angeles back in September. The combined value of the cognac in question came out to $65,820. American, Bacardi notes, has paid nothing in compensation thus far.
Worse yet, American stepped into a minefield of troubles thanks to rapper Iggy Azalea. Azalea, traveling with one-year-old son Onyx, was left “stranded” without luggage at Miami International Airport, Azalea noted.
Azalea took to social media to castigate the company over its practices. In turn, several others who follow the rapper noted their own experiences of being stranded without luggage.
Take all these factors together and suddenly, the “recovery narrative” just doesn't work any more.
Concluding Views
American shares come with downside risk. That alone is bad news; a company trading over its highest price targets is either better than people think, or about to take a fall. Given that American is losing luggage left and right — including that of celebrities and other corporations — it doesn't bode well for the “better than people think” side.
American hasn't paid a dividend in years. Worse, American is frantically losing on multiple fronts. Luggage, hedge fund support, public sentiment, and perhaps worst of all, money.
There are a few bright spots with American. Right now, though, it looks like the company has few other places to go but down.

4046.0,2021-11-08 00:00:00 UTC,Lagging business travel takes shine off transatlantic restart,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lagging-business-travel-takes-shine-off-transatlantic-restart,,,"By Sarah Young and Rajesh Kumar Singh
LONDON/CHICAGO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Planes will fill the skies above the North Atlantic again from Monday, a boon for airlines after 19 months of restrictions, but that alone won't be enough for carriers whose profits depend on filling the most expensive seats.
The real battle of the transatlantic, the world's most lucrative travel market, takes place at the front of the plane, in first, business, and premium economy class, where those paying the top prices help drive airline profits.
Question marks remain over the pace and extent of the return of corporate travel budgets, after the pandemic showed online calls and virtual meetings offered a workable alternative.
That's bad news for the likes of British Airways parent company IAG ICAG.L and Germany's Lufthansa LHAG.DE, whose profits have in the past been buoyed by corporates spending more by booking closer to departure and flying at more convenient times.
Some travellers are desperate to get back over the pond.
""We are in a relationship business and travelling is necessary to meet clients, to win deals,"" said Anthony Diamandakis, Citi's co-global head of Global Asset Managers.
For smaller, non-financial businesses too, travel is essential for trade.
""In my experience of the USA, it's a people market - deals get done face to face, with a handshake and looking into each other's eyes,"" Tony Kinsella, chief executive of UK-based materials development and testing company Lucideon, said.
The United States will allow fully-vaccinated Britons and Europeans to enter from Monday, fully re-opening to two-way traffic for the first time since the pandemic started.
""USA, here we come,"" said Kinsella, who already has his tickets booked.
LONG SLOG
Most experts believe that corporate travel will lag the recovery in leisure travel.
U.S. spending on corporate travel is expected to reach only 25%–35% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter of 2021, and 65%–80% a year later, according to a Deloitte survey of 150 travel managers.
One British FTSE 100-listed company, which did not want to be named, said it planned to reduce travel for internal meetings next year by two-thirds on 2019 levels, and by one-third for external meetings.
That means the full transatlantic restart might not be as lucrative as airlines would hope.
Europe-based carriers tend to be more reliant on transatlantic revenues than their U.S. competitors.
Pre-pandemic, those routes accounted for more than 26% of IAG's revenues and over 24% of Lufthansa's, according to Bernstein analyst estimates.
That compares with between 11% and 17% of passenger revenues at U.S. carriers American Airlines AAL.O, United Airlines UAL.O and Delta Air Lines DAL.N, and 16% of Air France-KLM's AIRF.PA.
UK-based Virgin Atlantic is even more exposed, with an estimated 60-70% of its revenues coming from transatlantic routes.
Airlines do not break down transatlantic profitability, but one analyst estimates that at IAG for instance, first class, business class and premium economy flying account for more than half of the profits it makes from transatlantic flying.
John Grant of global travel data specialist OAG does not expect transatlantic business travel to start to show any significant recovery until the second quarter of 2022.
""Major conferences in the first quarter of next year have already in many cases been cancelled since the planning cycle is so long,"" he said.
""Companies want to be sure that there is revenue to be had from such trips, so they will be waiting to see how economies and trade recover.""
LEISURE UPGRADE
Airlines are going to be looking to leisure travellers to fill the gap left by corporates, and after months of lockdowns their pockets will be deeper, encouraging them to splash out on that premium economy or business class seat.
According to Willie Walsh, IAG's former chief executive who now heads up global airlines body IATA, the importance of corporate travel to airlines is often overstated.
""Everybody assumes that people travelling in the premium cabins are travelling for business. They're not,"" he told a recent industry event.
Airlines are trying harder than usual to entice leisure customers to upgrade given the dearth of business travellers.
""We're seeing when people do take that trip, they're thinking more of the experience,"" said Virgin Atlantic's CEO Shai Weiss.
IAG, Lufthansa and Virgin have spoken of strong demand for premium travel, and said that there are also signs that business travel is returning.
Delta also said last month that its corporate bookings for Europe doubled to 30% of 2019 levels following the reopening announcement.
OAG's Grant said pent-up demand and seasonal holidays had helped lift fares on transatlantic routes in recent weeks, and the market would likely remain strong until mid-January.
""The absence of business travel will make the airlines wary of adding capacity back too quickly in the first three months of next year,"" he said.

""The biggest risk here to the market is not legislative policy or pandemic ... If the Fed chooses to react quickly and aggressively to persistent inflation, then the markets are going to have a problem.""

Some companies will inevitably be able to recover ahead of the pack, and some will be laggards.
In this Motley Fool Live clip from Nov. 19, Motley Fool contributor Lou Whiteman and ""The Wrap"" host Jason Hall talk about why Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) is set up well to take share from rivals including American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) in the quarters to come.
10 stocks we like better than American Airlines Group
When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*
David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and American Airlines Group wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.
See the 10 stocks
*Stock Advisor returns as of November 20, 2020
Jason Hall: We've seen airlines stocks as a group, even though a lot are still down, have really run hard and fast recently. I'm sure you've got an airline you can think of that's probably run too fast, and maybe it's too early in the recovery, to call it a good time to buy.
Lou Whiteman: American Airlines is still down 50 percent for the year, but they are up 25 percent in less than a month. Thanks for this vaccine news. People should be very careful with American. American was last to do a merger and a bankruptcy at the last down turn, so they are behind the other companies, Delta (NYSE: DAL), United (NASDAQ: UAL), Southwest, the other three in the big four, are well ahead of them as far as transforming the business. They have more debt than their rivals. They did have some trouble with buybacks. They were the target of a lot of criticism going into these bail outs. This is a company that's even when things normalize, and this could take years, they are going to have the weakest balance sheet, and they are going to need time to recover before they can go on the offensive. We're seeing Southwest start to go on the offensive, attack United and American, both at Chicago moving into new markets. I don't think they're going to go under, I think they're going to make it through the crisis, but American is going to be the laggard in a lot of the recovery. I would be very careful jumping on board this airplane just because the vaccine is coming, and the airlines are going to start getting healthy.
Hall: My view on this one, I think it's an interesting take there and I think you're probably right is, the idea you look at Southwest, Southwest is going to come out of this stronger and better shaped than probably any other airline. Because it's taking market share, because it has the financial capacity to do that while everybody else is weak. This is a situation where a lot of people are looking at the stock price for this company a year ago and saying, that's where it's going to be when it gets back to normal in a year or two, and they are anchoring on a previous price. This is a business what you are saying, that's probably going to be weaker when it recovers, than it was a year-and-a-half ago or so?
Whiteman: Yeah. I think it's going to be harder for them to show results for a long time. It could be the second half of this decade before this business is really ready to thrive. You're going to get it for a lot cheaper, Southwest are just trying the numbers, Southwest is only down 14 percent for the year, if this is right now, which is pretty amazing for an airline. But every down turn we've had, Southwest has gone on the offensive and they've just been vicious taking share. It's not going to be any different this time. American, United, both seem to be in their crosshairs. United can weather the storm. American, they're going to get by, but American is very vulnerable to the attack right now, so just be careful.
Hall: I love it, the takeaway here is you look for great companies that have great prospects, even if they're struggling now, versus just the stock that's fallen the most in the sector, thinking that you're going to get the most returns, because a lot of times they're down the most for a reason.
Whiteman: Absolutely.

351.0,2022-11-11 00:00:00 UTC,Carrier (CARR) to Aid Cold-Chain in Africa With Recent Tie-Ups,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/carrier-carr-to-aid-cold-chain-in-africa-with-recent-tie-ups,,,"Carrier Global Corporation CARR joined forces with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the African Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Cooling and cold-chain (ACES).
Per the terms of the partnership, Carrier and the international organizations will make enhancements in cold-chain development and training in Africa. 
With effective refrigeration and cold-chain technology, the alliance thrives to avoid food loss, which will positively impact farmers, manufacturers and customers in the continent.
CARR and ACES entered into an agreement to build a cold chain center in Kigali, Rwanda, to offer capacity building for farmers and refrigeration technicians, skill development for students and supply-chain professionals, and sustainable cold-chain solutions across Africa.
In collaboration with WFP and other leading companies, Carrier is developing a world-class Transport Training Centre in Accra, Ghana, to advance transport and logistics capacities across West Africa. It also aims to provide free online and hands-on training to nearly 400 people per year.
Carrier Global Corporation Price and Consensus
Carrier Global Corporation price-consensus-chart | Carrier Global Corporation Quote
Recent Efforts on Cold-Chain Solutions
The latest collaboration bodes well for CARR’s growing focus on expanding its cold-chain solutions to reduce hunger, food insecurity and carbon emissions, thereby improving public health.
This apart, in July, Carrier’s subsidiary Carrier Commercial Refrigeration came up with an EasyCube plug-in island cabinet for chilled and frozen products. The cabinet features automatic defrost and drip water evaporation, provides optimum product visibility and can be operated at two temperature classes.
In June, Carrier’s subsidiary PROFROID expanded its range of QuietCO2OL MC compact indoor refrigeration units with more than 20 new models. The latest models feature semi-hermetic compressors, making the QuietCO2OL MC provide large convenience stores with greater cooling capacities.
Carrier’s brand Carrier Transicold introduced its Vector eCool units in Australia in April. Vector eCool is a fully electric trailer refrigeration unit operating autonomously without a diesel engine.
These growing endeavors are expected to help Carrier gain momentum among customers, which in turn, is likely to contribute to its refrigeration segment in the days ahead.
The underlined segment generated revenues of $1.04 billion, accounting for 20% of the total third-quarter 2022 revenues, which increased 2% from the year-ago quarter’s level.
Strengthening Cold-Chain and Refrigeration Prospects
Carrier’s growing refrigeration products and cold-chain solutions are expected to continuously help it expand its footprint in the booming commercial refrigeration equipment and cold-chain markets.
Per a Future Market Insights report, the commercial refrigeration equipment market is expected to exceed revenues worth $51.8 million by this year-end. The report also states that the market is likely to witness a CAGR of 4% between 2022 and 2029.
According to a Grand View Research report, the global cold chain market is likely to see a CAGR of 17.1% during the 2022-2030 forecast period.
We believe, Carrier’s strengthening efforts in these growing markets will help it win investors’ confidence in the near term and the long haul.
Shares of Carrier have been down 19.8% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 42.1%.
Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider
Currently, Carrier carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors interested in the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector can consider some better-ranked stocks like Agilent Technologies A, Asure Software ASUR and America Movil AMX, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Agilent Technologies has lost 8.5% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for A is currently projected at 10%.
Asure Software has lost 13.8% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for ASUR is currently projected at 14%.
America Movil has lost 5.3% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for AMX is currently projected at 25.7%.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

3353.0,2022-07-26 00:00:00 UTC,"If Warren Buffett Isn't Afraid to Cut His Losses, Then You Shouldn't Be Either",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-warren-buffett-isnt-afraid-to-cut-his-losses-then-you-shouldnt-be-either,,,"Although it isn't a competition, many would consider Warren Buffett the Michael Jordan of investing, and for good reason. The Oracle of Omaha has invested his way to a $100 billion fortune (it was $120 billion in April 2022). But just as Michael Jordan has taken losses, so has Warren Buffett. Even with all the success Buffett has had in investing, he's made many mistakes along the way.
When you invest in a stock, your plan should always be to hold it long term. Buffett himself once said, ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes."" However, there may come a point where holding onto a failing stock may do you more harm than good, and you're better off cutting your losses before they get worse.
Image source: Getty Images.
Going against conventional wisdom
It's not always easy to spot a failing business. If it was, nobody would invest in (or hold onto) them. However, according to Buffett, there are warning signs, including when a business is getting bad results while being run by great management. His position is that great management will never win over bad economics. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, once owned a stake in all four major airlines:
Delta Air Lines (11%)
American Airlines (10%)
Southwest Airlines (10%)
United Airlines (9%)
Berkshire had paid between $7 billion and $8 billion for its stakes in the companies beginning in 2016, but it sold them for far less than that in 2020. Buffett himself took the blame, saying he was the one who made the decision. This short ownership stint goes against Buffett's traditional philosophy of holding onto stocks long term, but it shows how sometimes going against conventional wisdom is a better business decision.
In the past five years, Delta stock has declined over 40%, American Airlines is down almost 75%, Southwest fell over 33%, and United has shed 49%. Does that mean airline stocks won't bounce back? Of course not; they may make a great comeback, but that also doesn't make them great investments either.
It's always good to keep in mind the opportunity cost of money, which is the value you're missing out on by having money in one investment instead of another. There's no need to stay invested in a stagnant business when there are many other options likely to produce superior returns.
Selling can be a blessing in disguise
If you've truly lost hope in the potential of one of your investments, there's no need to delay the inevitable. Having it in your portfolio can do more harm than good the longer you hold onto it. Selling a particular stock at a loss can have some benefits too because of tax-loss harvesting.
Just like capital gains increase your tax bill, capital losses can lower it. Any capital losses, up to $3,000, can either offset any capital gains you have for the year or lower your taxable income.
If you're going to cut your losses short -- which sometimes is the best option -- you might as well get some tax relief for doing so.

Investors have been extremely optimistic about the prospects for a full economic recovery after 2020's coronavirus-plagued recession. Yet even as economic data starts to support the likelihood of a rebound, there's one thing that looms large on the horizon for investors.
In the next couple of weeks, earnings season will give investors their first real read on how things are going in 2021. Although no one expects those results to reflect a full recovery, they nevertheless will set the tone and decide whether investors have gotten ahead of themselves. What key businesses report could determine whether the stock market will keep rising from here.
All eyes will be on big banks
The first set of companies that will get attention for their first-quarter 2021 results will be major financial institutions. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) are expected to report on April 14. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Citigroup (NYSE: C), and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) will follow on April 15.
Investors are generally upbeat about big banks being able to mount a full recovery from the first quarter of 2020, which included massive loss provisions related to the pandemic. For instance, JPMorgan's earnings could more than triple from year-ago levels. Goldman and Citigroup will likely see earnings double, and substantial gains are likely for the other banks as well.

More importantly, investors will get a sense of how much major banks intend to return to their shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Those efforts have been ongoing since the financial crisis, but they were put on pause because of the financial stresses of the pandemic. If the news from Wall Street's finest proves favorable, then it could spur a further rally in financial stocks that could lead the whole market higher. If they disappoint, though, the banks could be the catalyst for a stock market pullback.
A look at industrial America
The other key area will be the industrial sector. Alcoa (NYSE: AA) will report on April 15, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) leads off the airlines on the same day. Most of Delta's rivals will report the following week.
Alcoa has already seen an uptick in interest from investors as demand for aluminum has been on the rise. After years of supply imbalances related to Chinese production and consumption of the lightweight metal, market watchers are increasingly optimistic that aluminum could be an even more important commodity than copper in the economic recovery worldwide. Alcoa's emphasis is purely on commoditized aluminum, so it stands to benefit from continued rebounds in use of the metal for electric vehicles, aerospace, and other weight-sensitive industries.
Delta's business is one of those areas, and investors expect more bad news from the airline for the first quarter. What shareholders will want to see, though, are signs of more passengers returning to the skies. Deliver that, and Delta could see its stock continue to rise. If the outlook is cloudy, however, it could prove problematic for Delta and its peers.
Stay tuned
Earnings season is about to start, and smart investors will be paying attention. What key companies like big banks, airlines, and industrial giants say could determine the course of the stock market for the rest of 2021 and beyond.

748.0,2022-05-12 00:00:00 UTC,Reasons to Hold Sealed Air (SEE) in Your Portfolio Now,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/reasons-to-hold-sealed-air-see-in-your-portfolio-now,,,"Sealed Air Corporation SEE is gaining from the ongoing demand for packaging for food, medical supplies and consumer staples, and e-commerce activities. The company’s focus on investment in capacity expansion to meet the strong demand for automated equipment and sustainable packaging will drive growth as well.

The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy), or 3, offer the best investment opportunities. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Let's discuss the factors that make the Sealed Air stock worth holding on to.

Sealed Air’s shares have gained 11.2% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 5.1%.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Better-Than-Expected Q1
Sealed Air’s first-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings per share improved 43.6% year over year to $1.12, driven by favorable price/cost spread and productivity improvements. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents. Total revenues were up 12% year over year to $1.42 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 billion.
Upbeat Outlook for 2022
Following the outperformance in Q1, Sealed Air raised net sales guidance in the range of $5.85 billion to $6.05 billion, which suggests an improvement of 6-9% year over year. Organic growth is expected between 9% and 12%. SEE anticipates adjusted EBITDA between $1.22 billion and $1.25 billion, which is expected to rise in the range of 6% to 10% from the last-year figure. Adjusted earnings per share is now forecast in the band of $4.05 to $4.20. The mid-point of the new guidance indicates year-over-year earnings growth of 16%. Volume growth, pricing, and productivity gains from the SEE operating engine are expected to mitigate inflationary costs and supply chain headwinds in 2022. Sealed Air projects free cash flow to be $510-$550 million for the ongoing year.
Solid Growth Projections
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2022 is currently pegged at $4.15, which suggests year-over-year growth of around 17%. The estimate has been revised upward by 1% in the past 30 days.
Cheap Valuation
Sealed Air’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio is 12.6, while the industry's average trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is 26.7. The stock is cheaper at this point based on the ratio.
Return on Assets (ROA)
Sealed Air currently has a ROA of 9.6%, while the industry recorded a ROA of 6.9%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets.
Other Growth Drivers
Strong demand for automated equipment and sustainable packaging solutions continues to drive Sealed Air’s food and protected packaging segments’ growth. In food, the retail channel and protein exports are expected to be solid. Its protein automation pipeline continues to grow across all regions, with major food producers committing to its SEE Touchless Automation future. The company has been witnessing year-over-year higher foodservice demand owing to the reopening of restaurants and other public venues. Backed by this, its fluid solutions portfolio, comprising Cryovac Barrier Bags and pouches for condiments, soups and sauces, has been seeing growth. In the protective segment, continued growth in e-commerce and fulfillment and higher demand in the industrial end markets are likely to drive performance. E-commerce sales, which contribute around 11% to the company’s total sales, have been on the rise amid the stay-at-home scenario.

Given the surging demand for recyclable materials, fiber-based solutions and automated packaging, Sealed Air’s focus on automation, digital and sustainability is likely to boost market-beating growth. SEE recently launched its new Digital Packaging Solutions brand prismiq to create game-changing value for customers powered by its breakthrough digital printing technology. Sealed Air’s pipeline for automated equipment continues to improve, and it has set a target of more than $500 million by 2025. It has been investing in capacity expansion to meet the strong demand for equipment solutions. These investments, along with the company’s acquisitions of Automated Packaging Systems, AFP, Inc and Fagerdala, will stoke growth.

Sealed Air’s Reinvent SEE Strategy, which was implemented in 2018, is focused on innovations, SG&A productivity, product-cost efficiency, channel optimization and customer-service enhancements. It led to around $64 million of benefits in 2021. The capabilities, operational disciplines, and governance processes established through the program are now embedded in the company’s ongoing productivity improvement system — SEE Operating Engine. It is aiding SEE in delivering sales growth and productivity gains, which are helping to mitigate the supply-chain-related challenges. In 2022, the company expects around $20 million of benefits from Reinvent SEE program and around $40 million in benefits from the SEE Operating Engine. This will continue to bolster the bottom-line performance.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) advanced 0.4% or 127.17 points to close at 33,129.55. Twenty-two components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory, while eight ended in negative.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 176.54 points or 1.4% to close at 13,236.01.
The S&P 500 gained 34.3 points, or 0.8%%, to close at 4,263.75. Ten of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red, while one ended in the green. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) rose 2%, 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) fell 3.1%.
The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 6.1% to 18.58. A total of 10.5 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 10.6 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, advancing issues led decliners by 1.30-to-1.
ADP Private Payrolls Report Drives the Market
Automatic Data Processing’s ADP National Employment Report for September was released on Wednesday. The report showed private payrolls increasing by 89,000 jobs in September, the lowest since January 2021. In August, the jobs count had grown by 180,000.
The numbers for September, which have hit almost a 3-year low, were way below expectations and have been cheered by investors who see this as a sign of the labor market loosening. A tight labor market has kept market participants on the edge throughout the period that the Fed has been raising interest rates because a robust jobs scene has continued to deter the central bank from going slow in policy tightening.
However, the more closely watched jobs report will be released by the labor department on Friday, and investors eagerly await its findings. In the meantime, ADP’s report provided much-required respite to the market, which was reeling under recession fears in recent weeks.
Consequently, shares of Tesla, Inc. TSLA and American Airlines Group Inc. AAL jumped 5.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Oil Prices Plunge on Weak Demand for Gasoline
On Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that finished motor gasoline supplied had fallen to 8 million bpd, its lowest in 2023. The post-tropical storm Ophelia and torrential rains are being seen as major reasons behind this drastic fall in demand.
On cue, oil prices plummeted in the session, with Brent crude declining $5.11, or 5.6%, to $85.81/barrel, while the WTI crude fell $5.01, or 5.6%, to $84.22. The S&P Energy SPDR slid more than 3%, bringing energy stocks down.
Economic Data
The Institute for Supply Management (“ISM”) reported that the ISM Services Index for September had come in at 53.6. The number for August was unrevised at 54.5.
The U.S. Census Bureau announced that factory orders had increased 1.2% in August against a consensus of a 0.2% rise. The July number remained unrevised at a decrease of 2.1%.
Per a government report, for the week ended Sep 29, U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) decreased by 2.2 million barrels from the previous week.

724.0,2022-06-24 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa (AA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-aa-is-a-trending-stock%3A-facts-to-know-before-betting-on-it,,,"Alcoa (AA) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.
Over the past month, shares of this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company have returned -25.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Metal Products - Distribution industry, which Alcoa falls in, has lost 17.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?
Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.
Revisions to Earnings Estimates
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Alcoa is expected to post earnings of $3.71 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +149%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.5%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $11.61 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +70%. This estimate has changed -7.2% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.82 indicates a change of +1.8% from what Alcoa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +5%.
Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alcoa is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Revenue Growth Forecast
Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.
For Alcoa, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.88 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +37%. For the current and next fiscal years, $15.05 billion and $15.24 billion estimates indicate +23.8% and +1.3% changes, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Alcoa reported revenues of $3.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.7%. EPS of $3.06 for the same period compares with $0.79 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -5.8%. The EPS surprise was +2.34%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Alcoa is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Conclusion
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alcoa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

3855.0,2022-01-19 00:00:00 UTC,Should You Buy United Airlines Stock Ahead Of Earnings?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-buy-united-airlines-stock-ahead-of-earnings,,,"As the world grapples with another Covid surge, macroeconomic recovery has become a key concern for authorities leading to fewer restriction measures. The shares of United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) observed another round of sell-off after WHO declared the Omicron mutation as a variant of concern and investors were wary of a decline in passenger traffic. UAL stock has lost $10 billion in market capitalization – compared to the $4.2 billion operating cash burn since February 2020. Considering stable domestic demand even during these uncertain times, Trefis believes that the stock is poised for more gains. We highlight the quarterly trends in revenues, earnings, stock price, and expectations for Q4 2021 in an interactive dashboard analysis, United Airlines Earnings Preview.
United Airlines fundamentals improved in 2021 despite a raging pandemic
United Airlines revenues observed a 38% growth in 2021 assisted by passenger demand in the second and third quarters despite a raging pandemic. The company’s total capacity stood just 28% below 2019 levels and the consolidated load factor was 76% in the third quarter. The operating cash remained positive at $2.3 billion on revenues of $16 billion in the first nine months of 2021. Notably, the TSA checkpoint numbers stand 18% below pre-pandemic levels – hinting toward a gradual recovery in the coming months. (related: United Airlines Stock: Should You Buy The Dip?)
How has UAL stock fared in comparison to the S&P 500?
UAL stock declined from levels of around $80 in February 2020 (pre-crisis peak) to levels of around $26 in March 2020 (as the markets bottomed out), implying UAL stock lost 67% from its approximate pre-crisis peak. Despite the multiple waves of the pandemic and an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the stock has gained 78% to reach $46 and we expect more room for growth given less stringent restriction measures imposed by governments.

4054.0,2021-11-04 00:00:00 UTC,U.S. airline disruptions cast a pall over holiday travel,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-airline-disruptions-cast-a-pall-over-holiday-travel-2021-11-04,,,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - A spate of high-profile flight cancellations has put a spotlight on worker shortages at U.S. airlines, triggering warnings of new delays over the holiday period as airlines scramble for staff.
It is a dramatic shift for an industry that was grappling with surplus labor as coronavirus hammered air travel just a year ago, and is the latest evidence of a widening labor crunch.
As demand in the United States roars back, carriers are struggling to keep up. The challenge is especially pronounced at American Airlines AAL.O and Southwest Airlines LUV.N, which have been among the most active in adding seats to meet demand.
American canceled hundreds of flights last weekend, citing weather and staffing. It faced similar turmoil over the summer.
Southwest last month suffered an operational meltdown that resulted in around 2,000 cancellations and cost it $75 million. Similar factors in August forced Spirit Airlines Inc SAVE.N to cancel 2,800 flights.
Days ahead of the late-November Thanksgiving travel rush, airlines are scrambling to avoid a repeat.
Meanwhile, they face a surge in holiday bookings amid declining COVID-19 cases and rising vaccinations. Southwest said last month ticket sales for November and December were in line with 2019 pre-crisis levels.
Rising demand and labor shortages have left airlines more vulnerable to bad weather, which frequently mars end-year holiday travel. Analysts say that could mean more travel disruption.
""If there's any weather involved, you can expect flight cancellations,"" said Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker.
SCRAMBLING FOR WORKERS
In a staff memo last week, American said it expects to have 4,000 new employees in the current quarter. It is also recalling nearly 1,800 flight attendants from long-term leave.
Southwest aims to hire 5,000 employees by year-end.
The rush to hire in a tight labor market risks driving up costs at a time when soaring jet fuel prices are squeezing profits.
Southwest is offering hiring referral bonuses to employees and has raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Even then, it says applicant rates are below pre-pandemic levels.
""The competition for the talent and for really good talent is even tighter,"" said Greg Muccio, director of talent acquisition at Southwest. ""A lot of folks ... are looking for a lot of flexibility.""
In the interim, both Southwest and Spirit have cut flights to prevent further outages.
Unions blame airlines for poor planning, which they say resulted in fatigue and frustration and made carriers susceptible to such disruptions.
American's pilot union said last month it planned to picket hubs to protest work rotas, fatigue and scarce accommodation.
""We're very concerned that management is stuffing the holiday turkey with uncertainty for the upcoming holiday travel period,"" said Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents pilots at American.
To be sure, not all airlines are feeling the same pressures. United Airlines UAL.O and Delta Air Lines DAL.N have, thus far, largely avoided some of the turmoil.
Both are flying fewer flights than rivals. United also struck a deal to keep all its pilots flying last year in exchange for reduced work hours and lower pay.
United and Delta restored just over 70% of 2019 capacity in the quarter through September. In comparison, Southwest ramped up its capacity to more than 98% of 2019 levels and American flew 80% of its pre-pandemic capacity.
Industry experts say United and Delta have been partially insulated from the labor squeeze by networks more focused on international markets, where demand remains relatively weak.
SHORTAGES DESPITE BAILOUTS
But recent congestion has triggered broader questions over decisions by some airlines to slash headcount despite receiving $54 billion in federal aid to help cover payroll expenses.
Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, sent letters in July to the heads of six airlines including American, Delta, Southwest and JetBlue Airways JBLU.O to demand explanations of worker shortages after billions in pandemic bailouts. Cantwell said at best each airline ""poorly managed"" the situation and at worst let taxpayers down.
While their responses to the letters have not been made public yet, airlines have said that the bailouts saved thousands of jobs, prevented bankruptcy and put them in a position to support the economy's recovery from the pandemic.
Industry experts say federal aid did help carriers retain workers, but problems started when the payroll program ran out of funds. With no clarity on funding and travel demand still weak, airlines asked workers to take unpaid time off or retire early.
""Had they retained 100% of their workers, they would have required more cash,"" said Cowen's Becker.
Airlines resumed hiring and bringing back pilots this spring as dipping COVID-19 cases brought passengers back.
U.S. air transportation employment in September was more than 12% below its pre-pandemic peak. By contrast, employment at restaurants and bars, struck equally hard by pandemic lockdowns, is just 7.6% below its peak before the COVID-19 outbreak.
Executives acknowledge a coronavirus-shattered airline industry is naturally more risk-averse, leading to tentativeness by some carriers when the recovery kicked in. Southwest, for example, didn't get moving with its hiring plans before July.
""We were kind of late to the game,"" said Southwest's Muccio.

2804.0,2023-03-16 00:00:00 UTC,Why Airline Stocks Fell This Week,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-airline-stocks-fell-this-week-0,,,"What happened
The remarkable post-pandemic momentum that airlines have enjoyed showed signs of cracks this week, and investors appear to be getting nervous.
Shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL), Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ: ALGT), Sun Country Airlines (NASDAQ: SNCY), and Frontier Group (NASDAQ: ULCC) all joined United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) in falling more than 10% for the week, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, after United issued a first-quarter earnings warning.
So what
Airline investors have seen their share of ups and downs over the last few years. The industry was devastated by the pandemic, which decimated travel demand. But the industry has seen demand bounce back strong since the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, helping the stocks to recover some of what was lost.
Demand has held up so well that United CEO Scott Kirby has suggested the effects of the pandemic, including more work flexibility, might be bullish for airlines and help balance out what has historically been a cyclical industry.
But the trajectory is not a straight line up. This week, United said it expects to post a loss of between $0.60 and $1 per share in the current quarter, significantly below the $0.63-per-share profit that Wall Street had expected. United blamed a combination of higher fuel prices and accruals from a potential new pilot deal for the miss.
Investors are betting these problems are not unique to United alone. Fuel is the single biggest nonlabor expense for airlines, and few are hedged. The industry is also facing a pilot shortage that has crimped growth, putting labor in a good position to negotiate new contracts throughout the sector.
Delta earlier this year warned first-quarter results would be impacted by its new deal with its pilots.
Throw in headlines about bank failures, and the consequential questions about the health of the economy, and airline investors were understandably nervous this week. Allegiant, Sun Country, and Frontier are all focused on budget-conscious leisure travelers and could find it hard to fill planes if the job market cools or if there is a disruption to the economy.
Now what
The good news is United reiterated its full-year guidance, meaning management is feeling good about demand patterns and believes it can make up what was lost in the first quarter as the year goes on. Indeed, if demand stays as strong as it has been, United and other airlines should have the pricing power to offset higher costs over time.
The normal January travel lull never came this year, and flights have been full through spring break. The airlines said that summer bookings look strong, though investors will be eager to hear more about that in April after first-quarter results are released.
There is no reason to panic yet, but there is enough reason for investors to be paying close attention. For those with a long-term time horizon, the industry is healthy enough to survive a down cycle, and there is no reason to run for the emergency exits. But United's warning, if nothing else, should be viewed similar to when a pilot turns on the seat belt sign: There could be turbulence up ahead.

2292.0,2023-09-01 00:00:00 UTC,"U.S. airlines, travel industry gear up for Labor Day weekend surge",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-airlines-travel-industry-gear-up-for-labor-day-weekend-surge,,,"By Priyamvada C
Sept 1 (Reuters) - U.S. airlines and airports have geared up for a busy weekend ahead of the Labor Day holiday as travelers plan to jet off to international locations and cooler destinations.
More than 20 million passengers will fly out of U.S. airports between Thursday and Tuesday, a 14% increase from the same time a year earlier, according to travel booking app Hopper, continuing the boom in international travel in recent months.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) expects to screen more than 14 million passengers between Sept. 1 and Sept. 6.
""We anticipate this Labor Day holiday weekend will be busy, with passenger volumes nearly 11% higher than last year—volumes that already exceeded 2019 Labor Day holiday travel volumes,"" TSA Administrator David Pekoske said in a statement.
U.S. travelers have been flying overseas with greater frequency in recent months, taking advantage of flexible work arrangements, the end of coronavirus testing mandates, and a strong U.S. dollar.
International bookings for flights, hotels, rental cars, and cruises for the Labor Day weekend were up 44% from a year ago, according to travel group AAA, while domestic bookings rose 4% compared with last year.
Travel operators with a larger international footprint have reported strong earnings, with companies ranging from Airbnb to Marriott forecasting strong future demand due to robust global travel and higher room rates.
""U.S. room rates were up 2.5% for the first 26 days in August and we expect similar rate increases year over year for the long weekend,"" said Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality analytics at CoStar Group.
AAA said Vancouver, Rome, London, Dublin, and Paris were the top five destinations for the long weekend.
Domestic cruise bookings also look strong, up 19% compared with a year earlier, AAA estimated. Airfare for domestic getaways is averaging $226 per ticket, down 11% from last year and 20% lower from the Labor Day weekend in 2019, according to Hopper.
While analysts expect demand to hold up this weekend, hurricane Idalia has wrecked havoc in certain regions in the United States, upending travel plans for thousands.
More than 1,500 flights were delayed on Friday and 60 flights were canceled, according to flight-tracking website Flightaware.com as Hurricane Idalia slammed into the Big Bend region of Florida earlier this week.

1699.0,2012-01-09 00:00:00 UTC,Do Alcoa's Earnings Even Matter? - Real Time Insight,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/do-alcoas-earnings-even-matter-real-time-insight-2012-01-09,,,"Alcoa ( AA ) reports fourth quarter earnings after the bell to ""kick off"" earnings season. Some S&P 500 companies have already reported but Alcoa is the first Dow component to report so it gets the designation of being the ""official"" kick-off.
The financial media pays a lot of attention to Alcoa on this day four times a year.
But should it?
The argument for paying attention to the ""first"" to report is that it can set a tone for earnings season. The argument goes, that Alcoa's report somehow foreshadows what the rest of earnings season might look like. So if it's a solid report with an upbeat outlook, then that's a good indicator for the rest of the earnings season.
But Alcoa's estimates have been falling for the fourth quarter. 8 estimates have been revised lower pushing the Zacks Consensus down to just 1 cent from 21 cents three months ago. The full year Zacks Consensus has also been falling.
The aluminum business is a tough one. Aluminum prices have fallen 25% since last year.
Alcoa's stock performance since the Great Recession has also not been a leading indicator of the Dow overall. Shares have significantly underperformed the average.
Alcoa has been in business for 120 years and is one of the largest aluminum miners in the world. It has been a Dow Industrial component since at least 1959. But we are now in an era when Apple has become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Tech giants Microsoft, Intel and Cisco are now also Dow components.
Is it time to replace Alcoa as the official kick-off of the earnings season with a company that is more relevant to investors?

1738.0,2011-07-25 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa Aims for $18 by Investing in ‘Green' Initiatives,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-aims-18-investing-green-initiatives-2011-07-25,,,"Alcoa ( AA ) has increased its focus on sustainability. The company's announcement to invest $21 million in expanding B&C Research - a part of Alcoa's Wheel and Transportation Products business - is its latest pro-environment expansion plan. Alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum and alumina and its 'green' commitment will help it stand out vs. competitors like Rusal, Rio Tinto ( RIO ), BHP Billiton ( BHP ) and Chalco ( ACH ).
Our price estimate for Alcoa is $17.70 , roughly 10% above the stock's market price.
Sustainability is key to Alcoa's growth strategy
Earlier this year, Alcoa entered a partnership with Codexis and CO2 Solutions to develop carbon capture technology for commercial uses - a move that could lower input costs for the company in the long run while reducing emission levels. We spoke about this in detail in our article, Alcoa's Carbon Capture Project is Green and Good for Business .
The recently announced investment in B&C Research is directed towards substantially improving the recycling and casting process currently employed to make aluminum billets for wheels. The upgrade is expected to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions - improving the overall manufacturing process.
What this means for Alcoa…
Alcoa's aluminum wheels reduce the overall weight of a vehicle and in turn improve fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And the soon to be implemented process will reduce the manufacturing energy requirements for Alcoa by as much as 25% while also lowering the company's carbon footprint. This will clearly help reduce manufacturing costs for its Wheels and Transportation products business.
The company reports the performance of this business under its Engineered Products division. This upgrade will help improve margins for this division in the long run.
You can understand the impact of an improvement in the EBITDA margins of Alcoa's engineered products division on the company's stock by making changes to the chart above.

178.0,2023-05-01 00:00:00 UTC,Will Agilent (A) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-agilent-a-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report,,,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Agilent Technologies (A), which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Testing Equipment industry.
This scientific instrument maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.33%.
For the most recent quarter, Agilent was expected to post earnings of $1.31 per share, but it reported $1.37 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.58%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.39 per share, while it actually produced $1.53 per share, a surprise of 10.07%.
With this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Agilent. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Agilent currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.40%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 23, 2023.
Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.
Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Free Report: Top 8%+ Dividends (paid monthly)
Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.
