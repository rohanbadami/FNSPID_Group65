1173.0,2014-04-07 00:00:00 UTC,"Momentum Slide to Continue for Netflix, Facebook? - Analyst Blog",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/momentum-slide-continue-netflix-facebook-analyst-blog-2014-04-07,,,"It was rough sailing for stocks on Friday with all major indices taking losses. The Dow lost 0.96% while the S&P 500 shed 1.25% by the end of the trading day. But the biggest sufferer was the Nasdaq, which closed the day 2.6% lower.
Internet, Biotech Stocks Take a Hit
This is the tech-heavy index's highest daily percentage loss since February. The decline comes right after Thursday's loss of 1%. The index is now 5% lower than its highest close this year, a milestone achieved on March 5.
More importantly, it was a cruel day for momentum stocks. Facebook, Inc. ( FB ), electric car maker Tesla Motors, Inc. ( TSLA ) and Internet radio service provider Pandora Media, Inc. ( P ) plunged 4.6%, 5.9% and 4.9%, respectively.
Meanwhile, Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ), Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX ) and online travel company TripAdvisor Inc. ( TRIP ) also plummeted. The stocks lost 3.2%, 4.9% and 6.1%, respectively.
Biogen Idec Inc. ( BIIB ), Gilead Sciences Inc. ( GILD ), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated ( VRTX ) and Amgen Inc. ( AMGN ) decreased 4.5%, 2.4%, 4.8% and 4.0%, respectively.
March's Trend Continues
This is a trend which has been continuing over the last month. Several big names have lost more than 20% during that period. The Street defines a drop of more than 20% or greater as a bear market and it seems that these stocks have descended into one which is their very own.
For instance, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( ALXN ) is 23% lower than its intraday high achieved on February 25. Meanwhile, Facebook has plummeted from the intra-day record achieved less than a month ago, losing 22% over the period. Yet the social media giant has still gained 3.8% this year, while Alexion is up 7% over the same period.
Are They Grossly Overvalued?
When using traditional valuation metrics, most of the momentum stocks seem grossly overvalued. The forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) for Amazon for the current financial year (F1) is 184.75. Netflix has a relatively modest P/E (F1) of 80.25. Tesla stands in between the two at 162.
Several momentum stocks fare no better when using other valuation metrics. Facebook has a P/E (F1) of 56.53, while its price to sales ratio is 17.76. The S&P 500 has an overall price to sales ratio of 1.7, which probably makes the social networking giant the most expensive stock on the index.
Investors Grow Wary
The high valuation of these stocks seems to be the primary reason for investors growing wary of them. The fact that most of them are priced well above the market average are keeping away potential buyers, probably rightly so. Momentum stocks grow on bullish expectations and this seems to be in short supply.
Further, there remains a possibility that when these stocks do rally, investors will sell. This is in order to make up for the losses suffered in the interim since those holding these stocks may feel at this point that they were picked up at the wrong time.
Earnings Remain Key
The earnings season will officially get underway this week when Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) reports its quarterly numbers. Earnings expectations for the first quarter of the new financial year are on the lower side. This is primarily due to the fact that a long and bitter winter season has grievously affected several sectors such as construction.
Additionally, there is some concern that the weakness in these big name stocks will spread over into the larger market. This seems unlikely and weakness in the broader markets may also be a result of wariness ahead of earnings. Several analysts are of the view that given the low level of expectations most companies will beat the Street's estimates.
For now, however, investors are looking for bargains elsewhere. These include industrials and financial stocks. Even the older and more established tech companies are emerging as good options. Momentum stocks may soon bounce back, but for now earnings hold the key. Good results may help them greatly while a slip up may keep them in the doldrums for a while longer.

2222.0,2023-10-04 00:00:00 UTC,Anglo's S.African iron ore unit plans to cut 100-plus jobs due to rail problems,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/anglos-s.african-iron-ore-unit-plans-to-cut-100-plus-jobs-due-to-rail-problems,,,"Adds quote, details in paragraphs 4-7
JOHANNESBURG, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Anglo American's AAL.L South African iron ore unit plans to cut scores of jobs at its head office as it restructures amid challenges in moving sufficient volumes to ports due to rail constraints.
Kumba Iron Ore KIOJ.J sent notice to cut 183 jobs, with the majority at its headquarters, Livhuwani Mammburu, spokesperson for National Union of Mineworkers said.
The job cuts could be pared back to about 141 workers if the restructuring plan is successful, Mammburu said, adding the labour group opposed the plans.
""Kumba said it's embarking on a restructuring and the main reasons they are giving is they are not able to transport more iron ore to the port due to the problems with Transnet,"" Mammburu told Reuters, referring to the state-owned logistics company.
Kumba was not immediately available to comment.
The miner's iron ore exports have been throttled by frequent disruptions on the rail line operated by Transnet. The disruptions, often caused by locust swarms, have recently been worsened by cable thefts and derailments.
As a result, Kumba has been forced to stockpile more iron ore at mines. Kumba's profit in the six months through June declined 17% due to the rail challenges and softer prices.

4075.0,2021-10-27 00:00:00 UTC,"Buy a coal mine, get a bonus: Glencore makes fortune on Colombian deal",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-a-coal-mine-get-a-bonus%3A-glencore-makes-fortune-on-colombian-deal-2021-10-27,,,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Clara Denina
LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - For investors seeking to burnish sustainable portfolios, coal mines are an anathema.
That sits well with top global miner and trader Glencore GLEN.L, whose purchase of a major coal mine in Colombia will generate a bonus of hundreds of millions of dollars before the deal has even been completed.
The miner bought the 66% shares in the Cerrejon thermal coal mine it didn't yet control from rivals BHP Group BHPB.L, BHP.AX and Anglo American AAL.L in June this year for an aggregate $588 million.
The deal was welcomed by BHP's and Anglo's shareholders as a major divestment of coal assets to meet emissions targets and shift towards sustainable energy.
The agreement they signed had, however, an unusual clause: Glencore would take over cashflows from the mine from 2021.
At the time of the deal, the Swiss-based miner said it anticipated the cash generated by the mine might reduce the purchase price to $230 million.
But the red-hot market for thermal coal has made that assumption conservative after prices for the most polluting fossil fuel soared on the back of Chinese power shortages and a European gas squeeze, said insiders and analysts.
One insider said that Glencore will get a ""fat cheque"" from revenues when the deal closes by the end of June 2022.
Broker Liberum estimates Cerrejon will generate $1 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) cash flow in the second half of 2021 alone.
""Exiting Cerrejon is part of our long-term strategic decision to focus on future facing commodities. There is no change to that view, irrespective of near-term thermal coal prices,"" a BHP spokesperson said.
Glencore, which already controlled a third of Cerrejon before the transaction, declined to comment.
""Our agreement to sell our minority shareholding in Cerrejón marks the final step in our responsible transition away from thermal coal operations as we continue to position our portfolio firmly towards supplying a wide range of future-enabling metals and minerals to our customers,"" Anglo American said in an emailed statement.
BHP and Anglo sold or spun off most of their coal assets, while Glencore has taken a divergent path and set a goal of managing the depletion of its coal mines by the mid-2040s, rather than selling them.
""Given the speed at which the deal is paying for itself, Glencore's policy to run down their coal portfolio is proving far better than a spin-off or a sale,"" said analyst Ben Davis at Liberum.
Davis said he based his calculations on European coal prices for delivery into Rotterdam minus the freight from Colombia. Coal prices soared to $280 per tonne in the second half of 2021 from as low as $57 last year. Davis expects coal prices to average $140 in the first half of 2022. API2
At an average production level of 24 million tonnes a year and per tonne production costs of $45, a banking source familiar with the deal put Cerrejon's EBITDA cash flow at $1.1 billion in the second half 2021.
If the deal closes as expected in the first half of 2022, Glencore would have enjoyed some 18 months of full cashflows from Cerrejon.
A top 30 shareholder at Glencore said some investors were warming to the idea of holding stocks in coal companies that pledge to run down mines responsibly without making them someone else's problem.
""At the end of the day, selling a mine doesn't make its output disappear ... The trouble for some investors is that they simply cannot hold stocks that have a coal exposure,"" said the shareholder who asked not to be named.

Air travel demand made a stronger-than-expected recovery as people started booking flights again, thereby boosting passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of most airlines’ top lines. Only a handful of airline companies (two S&P 500 members, to be exact) have reported their fourth-quarter 2022 numbers so far.
However, high fuel costs are likely to have hurt the fourth-quarter performance of airline companies. Fuel expenses represent a key input cost for any airline player. High oil price is augmenting fuel costs. Even though oil price declined from their multi-year highs, they remain high. Oil price was up 6.7% in the October-December period.
Given this backdrop, investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry keenly await the results of American Airlines AAL, Alaska Air Group, Inc. ALK, Southwest Airlines Co. LUV and JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU, scheduled to be released on Jan 26.
Our quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for a company if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). This combination increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Let’s delve deeper.
American Airlines’ top-line performance in the fourth quarter is expected to have benefited from upbeat air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front. Driven by the uptick, AAL expects fourth-quarter 2022 adjusted operating margin to increase 10.25-10.5% (prior view: 5.5-7.5%). Total revenues are expected to register 16-17% growth (prior view: 11-13% growth rate).
Passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of the top line, are likely to have been high, in turn, boosting the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for load factor is pegged at 84% for fourth-quarter 2022, higher than 80% reported in fourth-quarter 2019.
However, high operating costs are anticipated to have affected the bottom-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.  AAL expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.12-$1.17.
Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for American Airlines this earnings season as AAL has an Earnings ESP of +9.79% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. At the time, the fourth-quarter earnings preview article was issued, AAL had an Earnings ESP of +16.71% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Alaska Air’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues are likely to have been aided by continued recovery in air-travel demand and an improvement in passenger revenues. On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing, ALK has updated its fourth-quarter 2022 guidance. The company now expects fourth-quarter 2022 total revenues to increase 13-14% from the fourth quarter of 2019 actuals (the previous guidance had hinted at a 12-15% increase).  Load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) is now expected in the 84-86% band (earlier guidance was in the 83-86% range).
Meanwhile, with oil prices coming down in the latter half of the December quarter, fuel price per gallon is now expected in the range of $3.50-$3.60 (earlier guidance was in the $3.50-$3.70 band) for fourth-quarter 2022. Although the higher end of the fuel cost guidance has been lowered, escalating operating expenses, primarily due to fuel prices, are likely to have dampened Alaska Air’s bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALK’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings has been revised downward by 12% in the past 90 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for economic fuel cost per gallon is pegged at $3.62 for the fourth quarter, indicating 60.1% growth year over year.
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alaska Air this season as ALK has an Earnings ESP of -7.82% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.
Alaska Air Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Alaska Air Group, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Alaska Air Group, Inc. Quote
Southwest Airlines’s fourth-quarter 2022 performance is likely to have been affected by massive flight cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions during the Christmas holiday weekend. Following the massive cancellations, LUV expects available seat miles (a measure of capacity) to decline approximately 6% in fourth-quarter 2022 from the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. The previous guidance hinted at a 2% decline in available seat miles for fourth-quarter 2022. Revenues are likely to have been adversely impacted by $400-$425 million. Management expects a pre-tax hit of $725-$825 million to fourth-quarter earnings.
However, LUV’s focus on boosting cargo revenues is likely to have aided its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 cargo revenues hints at an 11.6% sequential increase.
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Southwest Airlines this time around as LUV has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present. At the time, the fourth-quarter earnings preview article was issued, LUV had an Earnings ESP of -101.96% and a Zacks Rank #3.
Southwest Airlines Co. Price and EPS Surprise
Southwest Airlines Co. price-eps-surprise | Southwest Airlines Co. Quote
JetBlue Airways’s fourth-quarter 2022 performance is likely to have been unfavorably impacted by Hurricane Nicole-induced disruptions in air-travel demand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2022 earnings has been revised downward over the past 60 days. Apart from the hurricane, the holiday calendar timing in 2022 had a greater-than-expected negative impact. As a result, JBLU now anticipates revenue per available seat mile for the fourth quarter of 2022 to be at the low-end of its earlier guided range of 15-19% increase from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. High fuel costs are also likely to have hurt JBLU'S bottom-line performance in Q4. On the brighter side, JetBlue’s efforts to reduce its debt load is encouraging. We are also impressed by the company's efforts to modernize its fleet.
Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for JetBlue this earnings season as JBLU has an Earnings ESP of +6.77% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

( AA ), one of the members of the Aluminum Transportation Group (ATG), applauded Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) on the launch of its Model S electric vehicle. The Model S is an electronic vehicle that intensively uses aluminum, which reduces weight and produces zero emissions while offering rapid acceleration and nimble performance.
The ATG educates vehicle manufacturers about the benefits of aluminum in transportation applications and increase its usage in transportation through research and development activities. The ATG acts as a central resource for the automotive and commercial vehicle industries on aluminum issues. There are increasing concerns about automotive safety and fuel economy and it is where aluminum plays an important role in the design and engineering of cars and light trucks.
As per Tesla Motors, aluminum will reduce the overall weight of Model S to help maximize efficiency and range. The structure of the model is designed in such a way that it not only provides protection to the passengers, but also enables smooth handling of the car. Aluminum forms an integral aspect of the car as almost every parts of the car that are visible are made up of aluminum.
Tesla intends to increase the production of Model S throughout 2012 and plans to deliver 5,000 vehicles by the year-end. Reservations for the model currently exceed 10,000 units.
Pennsylvania-based Alcoa Inc. is among the world's leading producers of primary and fabricated aluminum and alumina. The company is engaged in mining, refining, smelting, fabricating and recycling of aluminum.
Few months back, Alcoa released its first-quarter 2012 results. The company reported earnings of 9 cents per share in the quarter, compared with earnings of 27 cents in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding restructuring charges and other items, Alcoa's profit came in at 10 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents but missing the year ago profit of 28 cents. The impressive results were attributable to higher production and volumes, and improved market conditions.
Quarterly revenues inched up 0.3% sequentially to $6,006 million and edged up 0.8% over the prior-year quarter. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,735 million. The increase in revenues was driven by strong results in the company's Global Rolled Products and Engineered Products and Solutions businesses.
Alcoa competes with Aluminum Corporation of China Limited ( ACH ) and RioTinto plc . ( RIO ). Currently, the stock maintains a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term (1 to 3 months) Hold rating. We have a long-term Neutral recommendation on the shares of Alcoa.

1103.0,2020-12-03 00:00:00 UTC,AA January 2021 Options Begin Trading,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aa-january-2021-options-begin-trading-2020-12-03,,,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the January 2021 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new January 2021 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $20.00 strike price has a current bid of 14 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $20.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $19.86 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $22.68/share today.
Because the $20.00 strike represents an approximate 12% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 72%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.70% return on the cash commitment, or 5.11% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $20.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $23.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.65. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $22.68/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $23.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.69% if the stock gets called away at the January 2021 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $23.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $23.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 46%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.28% boost of extra return to the investor, or 53.11% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 133%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 124%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $22.68) to be 81%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

The union said some 1,115 workers were planning to go on strike, in addition to 1,422 who went on strike this Monday after negotiations with employers broke down last weekend.
If the escalation goes ahead as planned some 655 union members plan to stop work at Norsk Hydro's NHY.OL primary aluminium plant in Sundal, and 444 members at Alcoa's AA.N aluminium plant in Mosjoeen.
""We are putting increased pressure on employers to start the negotiation process again,"" Industri Union's leader Frode Alfheim said.
The strike, which started on Monday, is initially targeting several electrochemical plants, including Boliden's BOL.ST zinc smelter in Odda and Glencore's GLEN.L nickel refinery in Kristiansand.

3754.0,2022-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,"Mining companies may pause growth plans amid Ukraine war, inflation",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/mining-companies-may-pause-growth-plans-amid-ukraine-war-inflation,,,"By Clara Denina and Praveen Menon
March 3 (Reuters) - Flush with cash after bumper earnings, mining companies straddle a delicate balancing act as they benefit from soaring commodity prices amid the Ukraine-Russia crisis but also potentially face high inflation that could hit short-term demand and slow down growth plans, analysts said.
The world's largest listed miners, including BHP Group , Anglo American and Glencore are sitting on huge piles of cash after skyrocketing prices for copper, iron ore, coal, nickel and other resources buoyed profits.
High metals prices have so far outpaced inflation, which, partly driven by pandemic-related supply bottlenecks and tightening labour markets, is a thorn in the side of mining giants because it pushes costs up.
But the Ukrainian conflict could roil the world's economic outlook in unpredictable ways, exacerbating those inflationary pressures, analysts say.
The United States and Europe imposed sanctions against Russia's central bank and disconnected key Russian banks from the main global payments system. In retaliation, Russia could launch counter-sanctions and shut energy supplies altogether, the analysts said.
""Energy is a big cost input for mining operations,"" said Andrew Swart, head of Deloitte's mining & metals practice, adding that mining companies should brace for higher global energy prices given that Russia is a big oil producer.
A typical mine sees about 20-25% of its costs linked to energy.
""The Russian invasion in Ukraine has brought a whole bunch of new inflationary constraints into the global economy,"" said Tyler Broda, head of European metals and mining research at RBC Capital Markets.
""Whether it is the potential for scarcity of metals, meaning that we can't actually produce things, or the potential for Russia to implement counter-sanctions and shut gas supplies, but also just the impact of inflation on aggregate demand at these high levels,"" he added.
POTENTIAL RIPPLE EFFECTS
Russia is the world's biggest supplier of palladium and third largest producer of oil, nickel and aluminium. It is also a top exporter of coal and steel.
""The biggest impact for the industry right now is losing access to metals,"" Broda said.
So far, mining companies say, the impact of the conflict on business has been limited.
""The effects to look out for will likely be around disruptions to the flows of physical products, but it's still too early to see, albeit the metals markets seem to be pricing in concerns around constrained supply,"" Anglo American said in an email.
Western companies, including energy producers BP and Shell are severing ties with Russia, abandoning or exiting their operations and investments there.
Glencore, which has a 10.5% stake in EN+ Group, the parent company of Russian aluminium producer Rusal , did not go as far, but said on Tuesday that it is reviewing its stakes in Russian entities, including a 0.57% stake in oil giant Rosneft.
Rio Tinto said it is ""closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine and related sanctions."" It, too, has an alumina refinery joint venture with Rusal in Australia.
After the bumper profits reported in the last earnings seasons, analysts had predicted that rampant demand for metals to feed the energy transition and constrained supply would encourage miners to approve more projects, even in jurisdictions previously shunned for reports of human rights abuses or considered risky, such as Congo and Zambia.
""The big miners, the likes of Rio and BHP, have no use for their cash right now. Their cupboard is bare in terms of options to invest in projects,"" said Glyn Lawcock, head of mining research at Barrenjoey. ""They believe right now with elevated pricing comes elevated equity pricing.""

Shares of Walt Disney Co DIS.N fell 4.2% and were the biggest drag on both the S&P 500 and Dow after Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek said the resurgence of the Delta variant of the coronavirus was delaying production of some of its titles.
Concerns over China Evergrande Group 3333.HK have put investors on edge and added to recent worries over economic growth from the Delta variant.
Persistent default fears overshadowed efforts by Evergrande's chairman to boost confidence in the firm on Tuesday, while Beijing showed no signs it would intervene to stem any effects across the global economy.
""People have been preconditioned to buy pullbacks for most of the last year plus,"" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
""But that overhead nervousness is still there,"" he said. ""The Evergrande situation is still a black cloud hanging over global markets. Combine that with uncertainty with Fed commentary coming tomorrow, and there's a reluctance to get overly aggressive on the long side.""
Investors are waiting for the end of this week's Fed meeting that may shed light on when its massive purchase of government debt will begin to ease.
Officials will reveal new projections as investors also are on alert for any timing on rate tightening.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 50.63 points, or 0.15%, to 33,919.84, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 3.54 points, or 0.08%, to 4,354.19 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 32.50 points, or 0.22%, to 14,746.40.
S&P 500 industrials .SPLRCI led losses among sectors.
Adding to late-day bearishness, shares of American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O and JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O fell after records in Boston federal court showed the United States and several U.S. states on Tuesday filed an antitrust lawsuit against the companies. American Airlines ended down 2.8% while JetBlue fell 4.8%.
The S&P 500 index traded below its 50-day moving average, its first major breach in more than six months. The average has served as a floor for the index this year.
Analysts say a breach of the index's 200-day moving average may now be in sight.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 41 new highs and 98 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.73 billion shares, compared with the 9.95 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

4172.0,2021-09-24 00:00:00 UTC,DOJ Challenges JetBlue-American Airlines Alliance,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/doj-challenges-jetblue-american-airlines-alliance-2021-09-24,,,"Last year, American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) announced a unique agreement to cooperate in the New York and Boston markets in order to compete more effectively with key rivals Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) and United Airlines.
The U.S. Department of Transportation approved the arrangement (with certain conditions) in January. As a result, American and JetBlue have begun to implement their new partnership this year. However, on Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Justice and several states sued American Airlines and JetBlue on antitrust grounds. Let's see what this development means for both airlines.
What the alliance does
Today, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines dominate the New York market. While JetBlue has a base at JFK International Airport and American has small hubs at JFK and LaGuardia Airports, neither airline has nearly as many slots as Delta or United. That makes it difficult to compete. For example, American Airlines can't offer enough connecting flight options to offer a wide slate of international flights from New York. Meanwhile, significant holes in JetBlue's route network make it hard for the carrier to compete for corporate contracts.
In Boston, JetBlue is the market leader, with a 33% share of domestic traffic in 2019. But even there, Delta has been able to gain market share -- particularly among business travelers -- by complementing its nonstop offerings with a broad domestic and global route network that offers plentiful connecting opportunities. American has struggled even more, steadily losing share to both Delta and JetBlue.

The Northeast Alliance calls for American Airlines and JetBlue to coordinate route planning and scheduling (but not fares) and codeshare on a wide array of routes touching New York and Boston. Additionally, they are offering reciprocal frequent-flyer benefits to encourage customers to fly both airlines. Finally, American is giving JetBlue access to numerous slots at LaGuardia and JFK that it has struggled to use productively and profitably, enabling JetBlue to expand there.
To align their financial incentives, JetBlue and American Airlines will pool their revenues in the markets covered by the alliance, such that each airline earns the same revenue no matter which of the two airlines operates a customer's flight.
The DOJ objects
This week, the DOJ and several states sued American and JetBlue. They allege that the new Northeast Alliance is anticompetitive (in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act) and want to unwind it. The federal government and states believe the agreement essentially removes JetBlue as an aggressive, independent low-fare carrier that imposes price discipline on rivals.
Specifically, the complaint argues that while JetBlue and American have agreed not to talk to each other about pricing, they can still boost fares by coordinating to reduce the number of seats they offer. The DOJ highlights 11 nonstop markets from Boston, 17 nonstop markets from New York, and 98 connecting markets where a hypothetical JetBlue-American Airlines combination would significantly increase market concentration, making it ""presumptively anticompetitive.""

Top DOJ antitrust lawyers have met with JetBlue and American Airlines officials, according to The Wall Street Journal, but they were unable to reach an agreement that would avoid litigation.
A shaky case
Not surprisingly, American Airlines and JetBlue executives have forcefully defended the Northeast Alliance. JetBlue said it plans to add roughly 100 daily roundtrips from the three major New York airports relative to 2019. Most of that growth would have been impossible without the American Airlines alliance due to slot and gate constraints. It also intends to add dozens of new flights in Boston.
For its part, American Airlines noted that the alliance partners have already added 58 new routes and increased service on more than 130 others. CEO Doug Parker also highlighted the inability of either American or JetBlue to compete effectively with Delta and United in New York on a stand-alone basis.
Indeed, the antitrust case against the Northeast Alliance rests on shaky ground. While the arrangement would lead to less competition on certain routes, it will increase competition on many others, due to JetBlue's expansion plans and American's international growth. The DOJ argues that the airlines could grow without a revenue-sharing alliance -- but doesn't make a convincing argument that they would actually do so.
Image source: American Airlines and JetBlue Airways.
The complaint also underestimates other airlines' ability to insert new competition into markets where JetBlue and American Airlines might reduce capacity. Finally, recent history doesn't support the DOJ's contention that the alliance will have a chilling effect on competition. Over the past year, JetBlue has launched flights to Miami and expanded dramatically in Los Angeles, both of which are American Airlines hubs.
What does it mean for investors?
Although the DOJ faces an uphill climb to prove that the Northeast Alliance is illegal, investors must nevertheless prepare for the possibility that American and JetBlue will lose in court. The airlines also might offer new concessions to settle the case.
If the government successfully blocks the alliance, it will disproportionately hurt American Airlines. JetBlue would miss out on growth opportunities in New York and it would have to fight harder for customers, but the carrier would be able to continue its organic growth in Boston.
By contrast, without the JetBlue deal, debt-laden American Airlines will face an unappealing choice between shrinking further in key Northeast markets and ramping up service on routes where it is unlikely to make money. Thus, American has much more at stake in this fight.

The blue-chip barometer enters this week trading just below resistance at the 10,200 level and its 10-week moving average. Meanwhile, support should manifest near the 10,000 level in the event of a deep decline. Elsewhere, the S&P 500 Index (SPX) faces a similar situation, as the index is trading just below resistance at the 1,080 level and its own 10-week trendline. Support for the SPX should materialize near 1,040 on sharp decline. Heading into the open, futures on the DJIA and the SPX are trading 58 points and 5.8 points below fair value, respectively. Elsewhere, the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) has pulled back to its 200-day moving average. The last time the VIX tested this trendline (in June), stocks were sent lower while volatility rebounded sharply. On the plus side, this is expiration week, which has historically been bullish for equities. Furthermore, Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) will offer the first salvo in fresh round of earnings. Traders should have exposure to both sides of the market, as this could prove to be a very volatile week on Wall Street.

Aon said it intends to integrate Hewitt with its existing consulting and outsourcing operations and operate the business under the name Aon Hewitt.
Finally, speculation that BP pcl ( BP ) could be sold in pieces or as a whole has the shares up sharply in European trading. The Sunday Times of London said that Exxon Mobil ( XOM ) and another firm, believed to be Chevron ( CVX ), have sought U.S. regulatory approval to make a bid worth as much as $150 billion for BP.

The government lost an upper house election, but market players said worries about policy deadlock had been largely priced in. Turning to Europe, shares were bouncing back from lows. Miners lost ground, tracking weaker metals prices, after weekend data showed China's June copper imports fell short of expectations, though overall trade data surprised on the upside.

2480.0,2023-07-07 00:00:00 UTC,"JetBlue Ends Alliance With American, Chance Of Spirit Merger?",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jetblue-ends-alliance-with-american-chance-of-spirit-merger,,,"JetBlue Airlines (NASDAQ: JBLU) stock is declining by as much as 6.5% during Thursday's trading session, even after initially positive news regarding a tough but strategic decision by management. Executives have decided to break away from the airline's alliance with American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL).
After an eight-year-long winter in the stock, JetBlue has decided that it is time to finish the objective it had set to achieve a year ago. Ending a passenger-sharing agreement with American Airlines may keep FTC (Federal Trade Commission) and Justice Department blockades from prohibiting the acquisition once more; now, JetBlue is voluntarily becoming a minor representative of the U.S. airline industry. 
Considering that American Airlines' stock only declined by approximately 2.5% during the same session, it can be taken as an initial reaction by the broader market, implying JetBlue has more to lose in this deal than American after ending the alliance. Increasing the odds of a successful acquisition would make JetBlue the fifth-largest airline operator in the nation, providing it with more aircraft and routes, which is especially important when aircraft manufacturers like Boeing (NYSE: BA) are struggling to keep up with demand.
The stock's decline on Thursday, taken individually from the news, could be a smoke screen after investors dig into the roots of perception.
Market Preference
Now that Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) has made it into The Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: GS) 'Conviction' list, markets are also sending in their votes regarding what money 'likes' in the airline sector. By placing Southwest at one of the highest P/E ratios, markets are telling investors that they are willing to pay a higher premium for each dollar of the underlying business's current - and future - earnings, a preference not to be taken lightly.
Now that investors understand the market's preference for smaller airlines over the large ones like American Airlines or even Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL), a 'rally by association' trend can begin to develop for JetBlue.
When investors break down the price action in JetBlue's chart, it can become evident that ending this alliance and striving for the long-awaited merger are two catalysts that would help the stock find a bottom. Historically speaking, JetBlue's price-to-book valuation multiples, which can act as a reliable proxy for valuation apart from the mere stock price, are beginning to lay the rest of the foundation needed for a price recovery.
Sporting a current 0.8x P/B multiple, JetBlue is assumed to be trading at a 20% discount to its book value. It is also significantly lower than its normalized ranges of 1.5x to 2.5x. JetBlue analyst ratings may begin to seem a little conservative to those investors who understand the ramifications of a discount to book value, as the top-side price target only offers a 14.5% potential ceiling. 
Structured Future
JetBlue's high price of $27.2 per share in 2015 marked the last high for the stock, followed by a multi-year decline to today's less than $10.0 per share. The last time the stock peaked was in 2021 for a price of $21.7 per share; all of this, put into perspective, can point investors to two significant price levels that analysts may be too cautious to recognize and risk their accuracy reputations.
Taking Wall Street's 'Bear Market' definition, which suggests a 20% retracement from all-time - or recent - high prices, JetBlue's $17.4 level can act as a relative resistance level for traders to attempt to test once more before finding direction. 
The catalyst needed may lie within the Spirit merger, considering Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) carries an enterprise value of 6.8 billion; JetBlue will need to dig deep into its pockets to make the transaction happen. Looking into JetBlue's financials, it would seem impossible for the company to realize an all-cash transaction, so financing will be necessary for this merger to be realized.
Luckily for JetBlue investors, the deal was reached before the airline's sector recovered in the past twelve months, where the agreed value to be paid was a significantly lower $3.8 billion. JetBlue agreed to pay $33.5 per share, which would be an 88.5% premium to today's prices. This assumes that Spirit's $6.2 billion in debt would be assumed or refinanced by the new combined entity.

JetBlue Airlines (NASDAQ: JBLU) stock is declining by as much as 6.5% during Thursday's trading session, even after initially positive news regarding a tough but strategic decision by management. By placing Southwest at one of the highest P/E ratios, markets are telling investors that they are willing to pay a higher premium for each dollar of the underlying business's current - and future - earnings, a preference not to be taken lightly.","Executives have decided to break away from the airline's alliance with American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL).

2302.0,2023-08-30 00:00:00 UTC,Here's Why Investors Should Retain American Airlines (AAL) Now,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-investors-should-retain-american-airlines-aal-now-0,,,"American Airlines Group Inc. AAL is benefiting from improved air travel demand and debt-reduction efforts. However, escalating fuel costs are worrisome.
Factors Favoring AAL
Continued recovery in air travel demand, particularly on the domestic front, bodes well for American Airlines. Recently, management lifted the earnings per share forecast for 2023, primarily driven by the rosy air-travel-demand scenario.
The company now expects 2023 earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) to be between $3 and $3.75 (earlier view: $2.5-$3.5). Driven by upbeat demand, the current-year adjusted operating margin is now anticipated in the 7-9% band (earlier guidance:11-13%).
The carrier's debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025 end. The company aims to attain this objective through naturally occurring amortization. Also, it intends to utilize surplus cash and free cash flow to pay down prepayable debt. As of Jun 30, 2023, the carrier reduced its debt levels by more than $9 billion from peak levels in mid-2021.
Key Risks
The current scenario of rising fuel costs does not bode well for the airline. Oil price is moving northward mainly due to supply concerns triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war.  Even though fuel price has come down from the highs witnessed earlier, it still remains at an elevated level. Fuel cost per gallon is projected in the range of $2.55-$2.65 for third-quarter 2023.  
Zacks Rank
AAL currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 6.26% for Mativ Inc, 6.75% for Kronos Worldwide Inc, and 0.80% for Alcoa Corporation.

April 5 (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines LUV.N has recalled 209 pilots from a voluntary extended leave program to support its summer schedule, the company said on Monday, as airlines prepare for a recovery in demand as more Americans receive COVID-19 vaccines.
The pilots will return to active status on June 1 and will then complete all of the necessary requalification training requirements before they fly with passengers.
Among other major U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines DAL.N and American Airlines AAL.O have also recalled pilots who were sidelined during the pandemic.
United Airlines UAL.O, which reached a deal with its union to keep pilots active throughout the downturn, said last week it was preparing to hire about 300 pilots as travel demand rebounds.
Low-cost airlines have also recalled pilots and are hiring again.

2101.0,2023-11-17 00:00:00 UTC,ASIA COPPER WEEK-Anglo American on the lookout for lithium as EV metals demand grows,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/asia-copper-week-anglo-american-on-the-lookout-for-lithium-as-ev-metals-demand-grows,,,"By Mai Nguyen
SHANGHAI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Miner Anglo American AAL.L is identifying opportunities to secure off-take lithium materials amid increasing demand for battery metals, a company executive said.
Lithium is a key metal used in electric vehicle (EV) batteries and demand for the metal has been growing strongly in the past few years as economies transition to green energy.
The company does not own lithium mines but produces copper, nickel and iron ore, other raw materials needed to manufacture batteries, electric cars (EVs) and renewable infrastructure that will help the world transition.
""We don't have a lithium mine and we don't trade it, but we are on the lookout for lithium,"" said Paul Ward, head of marketing for base metals at Anglo American.
Anglo American's customers are asking for more types of metals including battery materials nickel and lithium, said Ward on the sidelines of the CRU World Copper Conference Asia in Shanghai this week.
The miner looks to provide debt financing for brown-field or green-field projects, with the objective of getting hold of off-take material for battery metals, Ward said.
""It's a very competitive market, but we're very engaged in and then we put resources and investment behind it to find the right opportunity,"" he said.
""If there are opportunities to secure lithium that's already been mined, that we feel comfortable with, and that is in the right form that we can sell directly to our customers, then that's also of interest,"" he said.
As the auto industry gears up to shift to making only EVs - spurred on by likely bans on fossil-fuel cars over time - the pressure to produce environmentally and socially responsible batteries has increased.
Ward said there was strong interest across the supply chain to declare the carbon content, or information about human rights, of the material and Anglo American has had about 100 customers joining its blockchain-based technology platform Valutrax.

4194.0,2021-09-19 00:00:00 UTC,3 Stocks to Avoid This Week,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-avoid-this-week-2021-09-19,,,"Every weekend over the past few months I've been trying to single out three stocks that will lose to the market in the week ahead. My three stocks to avoid last week were all over the place -- declining 7%, climbing 3%, and rising 4% -- averaging out to a goose egg as the loser's 7% decline was exactly offset by the smaller gains on the other two picks.
The S&P 500 took a 0.6% hit for the week, so I lost for what is just the third time over the past 13 weeks. Can I get back on track? This week I see Oatly (NASDAQ: OTLY), Stitch Fix (NASDAQ: SFIX), and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) as vulnerable investments in the near term. Here's why I think these are three stocks to avoid this week.
Image source: Getty Images.
Oatly
The lone sinker in last week's list was Oatly, sliding 7% as the company behind oat-based milk, yogurt, and frozen desserts faces valuation concerns following an initially well-received springtime IPO. Last week's slide sent it buckling below its initial May pricing of $17.
The stock is more attractively priced than it was a week earlier, but the math is still not kind. Is a company putting out a branded commodity really worth a $9.6 billion market cap on trailing revenue of just $528 million?
Oatly is growing fast as consumers embrace oat-based dairy alternatives, but the entire niche is booming to the point where it will attract cutthroat competitors drawn to the market opportunity. With little differentiation between the products, is a brand name enough to stand out in this low-margin market? Oatly has struck some smart distribution deals and it's ramping up its production volume, but it's hard to justify paying 18 times trailing revenue for a company in its situation.
Stitch Fix
There are only a handful of companies reporting fresh financial results this week, but one name that has me intrigued is Stitch Fix. It was a market darling last year, but the provider of curated wardrobe selections has shed more than two-thirds of its value since peaking in the triple digits back in January.
A lot has happened to Stitch Fix these days. It has brought in new leadership, and like most apparel-delivery specialists it has had to deal with supply constraints and spikes in fulfillment costs. However, the real threat it faces now is that shopping malls are starting to reach pre-pandemic levels again.
Stitch Fix was a smart choice for consumers in a pandemic willing to pay a premium for fashionista-advised e-commerce. With those same 4.1 million active clients itching to hit stores again, can it continue to hold up? Something else to watch were reports last month that a third of its stylists quit after the company enforced an end to its flexible scheduling policy. It will certainly be addressed during the call.
Analysts see a narrowing quarterly loss on a 24% year-over-year increase in revenue when Stitch Fix reports on Tuesday. The stock is depressed now, so even a whiff of good news can send the shares moving in the right direction again. It still has a lot to prove so it makes the cut until there's a fix for Stitch Fix.
American Airlines
There was some turbulence on social media for the legacy carrier last week after a video went viral of a mom and her family who were booted off a departing American Airlines plane after her two-year old toddler wasn't properly wearing a mask while experiencing an asthmatic attack. It was not a good look for the already struggling airline.
There are two sides to every story, and American Airlines did respond to the matter. The air carrier claimed that the crew wasn't informed of the young passenger's asthmatic condition during the incident. American Airlines also pointed out it wasn't just the mask issue, as the family was not complying with crew member requests to remain seated while on an active taxiway. The party was rebooked on a later flight without incident.
Obviously a single flight hiccup isn't reason alone to put American Airlines on this list. The real rub is that the airlines industry in general and American Airlines in particular have had a hard time getting back on track in the new normal. Revenue for American's latest quarter is still 21% below where it was for the same period two years ago. With corporate travel unlikely to make a full recovery and travel restrictions and pandemic-safety concerns keeping leisure travel in check, it's going to be a bumpy flight for American and its peers.
If you're looking for safe stocks, you aren't likely to find them in Oatly, Stitch Fix, and American Airlines this week.

4320.0,2021-07-19 00:00:00 UTC,Why Airline Stocks Are Falling Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-airline-stocks-are-falling-today-2021-07-19,,,"What happened
There is growing anxiety that the so-called Delta coronavirus variant will crimp the global economy and lead to a fresh round of travel restrictions. Airline stocks were under pressure on Monday as a result, with Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU), Allegiant Travel (NASDAQ: ALGT), Alaska Air Group (NYSE: ALK), Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ: HA), Sun Country Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: SNCY), and Frontier Group Holdings (NASDAQ: ULCC) all falling 5% or more at the open.
The sell-off was global, with Brazil's Azul (NYSE: AZUL) also off more than 5%.
So what
Airlines suffered through a miserable 2020 due to the pandemic, which all but wiped out demand for travel. Vaccines have brought a resurgence in demand and in stock prices, but there is growing reason for concern that the rally is not sustainable.
Image source: Getty Images.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded down more than 2% on Monday morning as a surge of coronavirus cases, including in highly vaccinated countries, raises concerns that the virus will be a long-term weight on the global economy. With a rise in new cases in U.S. domestic tourism hotbeds like Florida, it is possible that the summer travel surge will fall off, which would reverse some of the progress airlines have made since the beginning of the pandemic.
The resurgence is an issue for all airlines, regardless of their focus. Discounters including Southwest, JetBlue, Spirit, and Allegiant are focused on the U.S. domestic leisure traveler, and Spirit in particular was seen as a strong candidate to be the first airline to fully recover from the pandemic, assuming tourism demand doesn't fall back. Sun Country and Frontier are relatively new market entrants, with both airlines going public this year, and investors are worried they might not have the wherewithal to survive a repeat of 2020.
Delta, American, and United, meanwhile, have been focused on domestic flights of late but historically have generated better margins on international travel. The latest surge in new cases has likely pushed back the timetable on the return of international travel. And Azul has been a standout among Latin American airlines, but given Brazil's issues with the pandemic and the importance of international travel to the region's carriers, Azul is going to feel the strain of an uptick in new travel restrictions.
Now what
There have been enough twists and turns to this story over the past year-plus that I'd advise against too much panic or too much optimism. The airlines are once again trading on near-term sentiment, and not long-term fundamentals, because investors are not sure what to expect next from the pandemic.
With the sell-off, much of the U.S. domestic industry is down for the year. Back in March, I worried that the valuations had gotten ahead of themselves, but for long-term investors able to look past the turbulence, the stocks are beginning to look more reasonable. I'd focus on Southwest and Delta as long-term leaders with stable finances -- and avoid American, which entered the crisis behind its peers in terms of revamping its business and which continues to lag its rivals in terms of expectations.
The airlines as a group remain relatively healthy and should be able to weather whatever comes their way next. But those who own the stocks should fasten their seatbelts ahead of an uncertain ride.

Dec 14 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes were set for a strong open on Monday as travel stocks surged on the launch of a nationwide COVID-19 vaccine campaign, while Alexion Pharmaceuticals jumped following a bumper buyout offer from Britain's AstraZeneca.
Shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech PFE.N, BNTX.O vaccine fanned out to distribution points across the United States on Sunday, with injections set to begin later on Monday.
The inoculations are seen as pivotal toward ultimately halting the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed more than a million lives around the world and bought economic activity to a halt.
""There is no question the market is very optimistic about the vaccines finally being delivered,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital Llc in New York.
Cruise operators Carnival Corp CCL.N and Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL.N rose 4.7% and 3.1%, respectively, in premarket trade, while stocks of major airline operators rose between 1.5% and 3.0%, with American Airlines Group AAL.O leading gains.
Travel and leisure stocks are the worst hit by restrictions on movement due to the virus outbreak, and have reacted positively to any vaccine-related news.
At 8:19 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 247 points, or 0.82%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 27 points, or 0.74%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 55.5 points, or 0.45%.
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc ALXN.O surged 31.3% and was set to hit a 4-1/2 year high after drugmaker AstraZeneca AZN.L, AZN.O said it would buy the U.S. biotech firm for $39 billion in one of this year's biggest mergers. AstraZeneca's U.S.-listed shares fell 5.8%.
""It is a sign that animal spirits are back ... companies are reluctant to do deals when they have a negative outlook on the future, but the fact that you are seeing these types of big deals on merger Mondays is a sign of things to come,"" Hayes added.
Shares of delivery firms FedEx Corp FDX.N and United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, which are leading the vaccine distribution project, rose about 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.
U.S. stocks had rallied through the past few weeks, with the S&P 500 touching a series of record highs as markets bet on the swift approval and roll-out of a vaccine.
But uncertainty over more fiscal stimulus had stifled gains, after the Senate last week approved a one-week extension of federal funding to avoid a government shutdown and to provide more time for negotiations on coronavirus relief and an overarching spending bill.
Among other movers, ecommerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N shed 1.5% after China warned its internet majors of more anti-trust scrutiny, slapped fines and announced probes into deals involving Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK.

1630.0,2012-04-13 00:00:00 UTC,The ONE Thing that Could Ruin a Great Investment,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/one-thing-could-ruin-great-investment-2012-04-13,,,"It's always intriguing to look at the list of the most heavily-shorted stocks. Many investors like to see which companies are expected to tumble by various short-interest gauges. Owning these stocks long-term can give pause, and perhaps a reason to sell if short sellers' arguments appear to be on the mark. Other investors use the list of the most heavily-shorted stocks to find short candidates themselves. And that's a huge mistake. That's because the most-heavily shorted stocks are often the biggest gainers when major events come to pass.
We've seen this phenomenon again in recent days. On Tuesday morning, April 10, distressed grocery chain Supervalu ( SVU ) weighed-in with quarterly results. They were pretty bad, but perhaps not as bad as the most aggressive short-sellers assumed. These short sellers had been holding 73 million shares in short accounts, making this the fourth most-shorted stock on the New York Stock Exchange. That short interest equated to an eye-popping 14 days' worth of trading volume .
Simply delivering bad but not horrible earnings led investors to embark on massive short-covering. By the end of trading on Thursday, shares had risen a hefty 23%. Some of that upward spike surely came from short-sellers covering their position by buying back borrowed stock. Roughly 10 million shares traded hands daily going into the quarterly report , though that figure spiked to 38 million on the day results were released.
Later that day, Alcoa ( AA ) weighed in with results that were better than analysts had forecasted. As the fifth most heavily-shorted stock on the market , it should come as no surprise that shares quickly zoomed higher and are now up nearly 10% in the last few trading sessions.
The key takeaway: it might be wiser to see if heavily-shorted stocks have more upside than the short-sellers might think. If so, those shorts may unwittingly force shares up for you with all of their buying efforts as they cover positions.
This is food for thought as we head into the teeth of the earnings season . Here are some of the top targets for short sellers, and the expected dates for them to report results.
Risks and rewards...
Safeway ( SWY ) , another heavily-shorted grocer, also highlights the risk of betting against such stocks. Rumors have swirled that the company may get acquired, and these rumors appear to have little merit. Still, just the rumor has likely spooked short-sellers, and shares are now up for four straight sessions (at the time of this writing).
To be sure, some companies appear to deserve to attention of short-sellers. For example, I laid out the long-term threats in place for video-game retailer Gamestop ( GME )back in October 2011 , and though shares are off more than 10% since then (as the broader market has moved steadily upward), recently released sales data imply even worsening quarterly results in the periods ahead. Sales of video games and consoles slid sharply in March, according to NPD Group, and it's getting harder to see how this company can earn more than $3 a share in fiscal (January) 2013 and 2014, as analysts currently anticipate. Still, with such a huge short position in place, it may be wiser to sell this stock (if you own it long) and then short it outright.
Profiting from the ""short squeeze ""
If you want to angle to profit from a potential short squeeze , it makes sense to target stocks that have huge short positions in relation to their daily trading volume (known as ""days-to-cover"").
These stocks include:
• St. Joe ( JOE ) , a real-estate concern, with 36 days to cover
• Briggs & Stratton (BGG) , small engine maker, with 28 days to cover
• Meredith Corp (MDP) , a media firm, with 27 days to cover
• A merican Greetings (AM) , which makes greeting cards with 26 days to cover.
[block:block=16]You should only look to go against short sellers with these stocks if your own research provides a clear case that business trends are OK and not in trouble as short sellers likely suspect.
Risks to Consider: It only pays to focus on a potential short squeeze if you think the market is going higher. A slumping market could well prove these short-sellers right, even if they're wrong.
Action to Take --> You should always check the size of the short position before investing in any stock. If you're going long, then you'll want to at least know what the shorts are thinking. And if you're thinking of going short, tread very carefully, lest you get caught up in a short squeeze if the total short position is already quite large.

3950.0,2021-12-15 00:00:00 UTC,Airlines CEOs To Testify Before Senate Panel Ahead Of Holiday Season Rush,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/airlines-ceos-to-testify-before-senate-panel-ahead-of-holiday-season-rush,,,"(RTTNews) - Executives of different airlines will take questions from a Senate panel on Wednesday on the issue of flight cancellations and staff shortfalls in spite of securing $54 billion in taxpayer aid to help cover labor costs during the Coronavirus pandemic period. The CEOs of airline companies like American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines and the chief of operations at Delta will take the stand before the panel. In their written testimony for the hearing of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, the executives said that the government aid helped them tide over the crisis and they can now focus on hiring and revamping the airlines. The Senate panel will mostly ask the airline companies as to how they are preparing for the upcoming months of high travel and by when customers would start receiving their pending refunds.
American airline companies are said to have lost around $35 billion last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and according to executives, the Payroll Support Program, which stopped them from laying off workers, was a lifesaver for them to overcome the crisis.
In his testimony, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said, ""It's not an exaggeration to say the program saved the airline industry, which Congress and the administration recognized as critical infrastructure that is as essential to the economy as it is unique.""
Delta chief of operations, John Laughter said, ""While we have seen travel stabilize across the U.S., the Omicron variant of COVID has demonstrated the ongoing volatility of the pandemic.""
While airlines could not lay off workers, they brought down the number of working people by getting workers to take voluntary measures like buyouts, leaves of absence or temporarily kept away workers in exchange for reduced pay. The payroll aid was given mostly in the form of grants, which need not be repaid as well as some loans.
Airline operations were also affected by staffing shortfalls and other issues line exacerbated routine problems, bad weather, and led to many flight cancellations, especially with the holiday season around the corner. Airlines were adding staff as soon as they could to make up for the loss.
In July, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash, the committee's chairwoman wrote to major airline executives, raising issue about staffing problems' role in flight disruptions. ""This reported workforce shortage runs counter to the objective and spirit of the PSP, which was to enable airlines to endure the pandemic and keep employees on payroll so that the industry was positioned to capture a rebound in demand,"" she wrote.
United Airlines, along with Delta, has been more conservative about bringing back flights than American and Southwest.
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, who worked closely with airline executives and lawmakers to get the payroll support approved, is also scheduled to testify in front of the committee. She called for increased protections for cabin crew when they come in contact with customers.

4597.0,2021-04-01 00:00:00 UTC,Expect American Airlines Stock to Take Off by Summer as Bookings Soar,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/expect-american-airlines-stock-to-take-off-by-summer-as-bookings-soar-2021-04-01,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) announced on March 29 that its recent seven-day moving average of its net bookings was an amazing 90% of the level in 2019. This is fantastic news for the company and implies that people are returning to flying in droves. Moreover, it bodes extremely well for AAL stock, and I now expect it will do extremely well by the end of the summer.

In fact, AAL stock is already up over 50% year-to-date, and, unbelievably, it is up over 95% in the past year. Who would have thought this a year ago? Only contrarian investors would have.
This makes all the airline stocks naysayers look very bad. Chief among them is Warren Buffett, who made an extremely bad move by selling all of Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) airline stocks last May. I wrote about this earlier this month, including his unwillingness to admit that his move was a mistake.
Analysts Are Warming Up
Some are concerned about the travel trends in Europe, which seem to be quite different than in the U.S. A U.K. minister actually recommended that people not book their summer vacations yet. One analyst at Goodbody said that there are growing fears that a second summer of travel will be lost.
Contrast that with the fact that American Airlines recently recalled 2,000 furloughed airline pilots, as have other airlines, according to the Financial Times. In fact, according to the article, some travel execs in Europe are worried if the U.S. opens up and Europe stays relatively closed as it is now, that that would bring a huge inflow of traffic into the U.S. — travel Europe would rather have.

The 8 Biggest Growth Stocks of the First Quarter
In fact, American Airlines recently said it expects to fly most of its fleet in the coming months. This is due to strong domestic and short-haul international bookings. It cites the fact that Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations have fallen.
More people now have received vaccinations, which is helping lower the infection rate. To aid in this effort, American has begun providing employees the single-shot Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) vaccine at O’Hare airport.
This year, analysts expect American Airlines revenue will rise 50.7% to $26.08 billion on average, up from $17.3 billion last year. Next year they see even sales at $36.85 billion, or 41% higher over this year. This puts AAL stock, now with a market capitalization of about $15 billion, at just 40% of 2022 forecast sales.
However, analysts still are not projecting net income profits for American Airlines for some time. For example, earnings per share (EPS) of just 17 cents are forecast for 2022. Significant earnings are not foreseen before 2023 when they project $2.27 in EPS.
What to Do With AAL Stock
This puts AAL stock on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 7.4 times. However, if we discount the earnings from 2023, three years in the future by 15% each year, the adjusted EPS is 65.75% of that figure. This works out to $1.49 per share and makes the adjusted price-to-earnings ratio higher at 12 times earnings.
Even at this higher adjusted P/E multiple, AAL stock does not appear to be too expensive. In fact, the stock could easily rise another 50% from here and it would not seem expensive.
I suspect that will happen over this summer as the airline experiences more bookings, higher revenue and better financial performance. I believe that will also lead analysts to upgrade their view of AAL stock. Granted, many of them will be focused on the airlines that are achieving cash flow profitability much sooner.
However, keep in mind that AAL stock is at the bottom of many analysts’ lists to recommend. For example, TipRanks.com indicates that 13 analysts have set their average target price at $18.89 over the last three months. This represents a potential downside risk of about 21% from the current price.
Therefore, patient investors will take advantage of any weakness in AAL stock over the next several months. That will likely turn out to be a good investment over the long run.

4336.0,2021-07-14 00:00:00 UTC,Wall Street Love Is Sending These 2 Nasdaq Stocks Higher,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-street-love-is-sending-these-2-nasdaq-stocks-higher-2021-07-14,,,"The stock market moved higher on Wednesday morning, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) was one of the best performing markets on Wall Street. As of 11 a.m. EDT, the Nasdaq was up half a percent and doing its best to a third of a percent even as some other market benchmarks were down on the day.
Wall Street analysts often have dramatic short-term impacts on stocks. On Wednesday, a couple of well-known stocks were beneficiaries of positive comments from professional investors. Below, we'll look more closely at lululemon athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) to see why they're headed higher and what Wall Street's finest expect from them.
Goldman loves Lululemon
Shares of Lululemon were up 2.5% on Wednesday morning. The yoga and athletic apparel specialist got a huge vote of confidence from one of Wall Street's most-followed companies.
Goldman Sachs put Lululemon on its conviction list, accenting its buy rating on the retailer. Goldman's price target of $447 per share offers about 18% more upside even after accounting for the rise thus far on Wednesday.

The argument favoring Lululemon is one that shareholders have seen before. On one hand, Lululemon did a good job during the pandemic of building out its digital distribution channel, and the experience helped boost brand awareness among consumers. However, as retailers recover from the pandemic, Lululemon has a new opportunity to capture people coming back to brick-and-mortar retail, especially given its strong customer loyalty and close-knit community of brand ambassadors and devoted fans.
With the move, Lululemon is getting close to its all-time high from September 2020. From there, the sky could be the limit for the yoga apparel retailer.
American gains altitude
Elsewhere, shares of American Airlines Group picked up 4%. The airline stock has faced huge challenges over the past year and a half, but at least one Wall Street analyst thinks that the worst might be over for American.
Analysts at Citi upgraded American from sell to neutral, citing a more balanced risk-reward proposition after the stock's recent decline. Citi has had a price target of $21.50 per share on the stock, and the drop below that level has made the airline more attractive from a valuation perspective.
Investors also got some positive business news from American. The airline upgraded its assessment of how revenue is likely to have fared in the second quarter, with new predictions calling for a 37.5% drop in sales compared to pre-pandemic levels two years ago. Obviously, that looks terrible, but it's better than previous guidance for a 40% decline.
Losses won't end anytime soon for American, but airlines appear to be moving in the right direction. It's unclear how long that will last, especially if new fears about the potential for COVID-19 variants prolong border closures for international travel and even bring back lockdown measures. For now, though, airline stock investors seem to be hoping for the best even as they make plans for what could be worst-case scenarios going forward.

835.0,2022-03-24 00:00:00 UTC,Why Is Alcoa Stock Attracting Investor Optimism?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-alcoa-stock-attracting-investor-optimism,,,"The shares of Alcoa (NYSE: AA) continued an upward trajectory as commodity prices surged due to the Russia-Ukraine war and skyrocketing inflation. Alcoa is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products with operations across nine countries. As the WHO actively explores the criteria to end the pandemic, macroeconomic growth is expected to continue in 2022 despite the ripple effects of war in Europe. Thus, Alcoa’s revenues are expected to remain strong for the year assisted by growing demand and strength in commodity prices. Trefis highlights the historical trends in Alcoa’s revenues across key operating segments in an interactive dashboard analysis.
How did Alcoa perform in 2021?
In 2021, Alcoa reported a 30% (y-o-y) growth in total revenues assisted by rising prices of alumina and aluminum from pent-up demand and uncertainties surrounding the Russia-Ukraine war. The company’s Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum segments account for 2%, 26%, and 72% of total sales, respectively. Geographically, the U.S., Netherlands, Australia, Spain, Brazil, and Other regions account for 43%, 22%, 17%, 12%, 5%, and 1% of total sales, respectively. However, around 65% of the company’s long-lived assets including plant and machinery are located in Australia, Brazil, and Iceland. With $920 million of cash from operations and $565 million of net proceeds from investment activities, the company repaid $800 million of long-term debt and distributed dividends for the first time since its inception in 2016. Per recent filings, the company expects the transportation, construction, and packaging industries to be key demand hubs for aluminum in the coming years. Thus, there is a strong likelihood of demand exceeding supply and assisting cash generation capabilities of Alcoa in the coming years.

AA stock declined from levels of around $17 in February 2020 (pre-crisis peak) to levels of around $6 in March 2020 (as the markets bottomed out), implying AA stock lost 66% from its approximate pre-crisis peak. It observed a strong rally post broader market sell-off and has reached the highs of $82 at present. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index first fell 34% as lockdowns were imposed in many countries and since almost doubled in value.

A spokesperson said, ""Although testing negative multiple times prior to the Senate Commerce Committee Hearing, Gary tested positive for COVID-19 after returning home, experiencing mild symptoms, and taking a PCR test. Gary is doing well and currently resting at home, he has been fully vaccinated and received the booster earlier this year. Gary's symptoms continue to be mild, and each day he is moving closer to a full recovery."" Kelly was joined by the CEOs of United Airlines Co. (UAL), American Airlines Co. (AAL), and Delta Airlines (DEL) and a flight attendant union president. The Senate Commerce Council asked the representatives about a $54 billion federal support that was given to the airlines to support the companies during the pandemic lockdown. United Airlines CEO and Delta Air's COO were sitting in close proximity with Kelly as well Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants. All three have tested negative as of Friday but will continue to keep testing for the CDC-advised period. The lawmakers also asked the companies about the mask mandates and how soon can the passengers fly maskless. In reply, Kelly said, ""I think the case is very strong that masks don't add much if anything in the air cabin environment."" The reply has caused some raised eyebrows but the CEO issued a note of clarification on Friday in support of the current administration's decision. ""I confused some with a short answer to a question about masks. So, to be clear, I and Southwest and along with [U.S. airline lobbying group] Airlines for America are all aligned and support the current federal mask mandate at airports and on airplanes. The majority of our Employees and Customers have felt it has been an important layer of protection, and I certainly agree with that. So we'll continue to rely on the advice of our medical experts regarding the necessity of masks. And my apologies for any confusion!""

The survey suggested growth would have been even faster without supply bottlenecks that have led to an unprecedented rise in input costs.
While investors worry that higher inflation could force the European Central Bank to dial back its stimulus measures, policymakers have said in recent weeks that the rise in prices is transitory and have reaffirmed continued support.
""We've had the Fed and ECB say they expect a surge in inflation as economies open up,"" said Keith Temperton, a sales trader at Forte Securities.
""It will become a problem once the economies have opened up and numbers continue higher. Until then, the market is embracing what we're seeing.""
Euro zone consumer prices data for May is due later in the morning. Data on Monday showed Germany's annual consumer price inflation accelerated in May, advancing further above the ECB's target of close to but below 2%.

WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday issued new approvals for additional altimeters that allow about 78% of the U.S. commercial air fleet to perform low-visibility landings at airports where 5G C-band wireless is deployed.
Some flights were being affected at San Francisco because of low visibility, with some diverted to other airports or canceled, airlines said.
Airplane models with one of 13 cleared altimeters include all Boeing BA.N 717, 737, 747, 757, 767, 777, 787 and MD-10/-11 models; all Airbus AIR.PA A300, A310, A319, A320, A330, A340, A350 and A380 models; and some Embraer EMBR3.SA 170 and 190 regional jets. The FAA said it anticipated ""some altimeters will be too susceptible to 5G interference"" and will be prohibited from performing low-visibility landings near 5G deployments.
AT&T T.N and Verizon Communications VZ.N agreed late Tuesday to delay switching on new telecom towers near key airports even as they turned on the new 5G C-Band service.
Radio altimeters are used to give data on height above grounds for bad-weather landings.
President Joe Biden on Wednesday said he had ""pushed as hard I can to have the 5G folks hold up and abide by what was being requested by the airlines.""
Verizon will temporarily not turn on about 500 towers near airports, sources told Reuters, or less than 10% of their planned deployment, while the carriers and the administration work on a permanent solution.

3760.0,2022-02-28 00:00:00 UTC,Why Airline Shares Are Falling Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-airline-shares-are-falling-today,,,"What happened
The military conflict in Europe is adding a fresh complication to the travel industry's pandemic recovery. Shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), and American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) all traded down as much as 5% on Monday as investors attempt to assess what comes next for the U.S.'s internationally focused airlines.
So what
Airline stocks are dealing with another unexpected headwind as the industry attempts to move past the pandemic. COVID-19 starved the industry of revenue, causing companies to take on significant debt to survive. As vaccines have gained traction, we've seen the beginnings of a recovery, though it will still take years for airlines to get their balance sheets back in order.
Image source: Getty Images.
The war in Europe threatens to further complicate the recovery. Full-service airlines like Delta, United, and American tend to generate higher margins on international flights, and access to all corners of the globe is a key selling point for an airline trying to win lucrative corporate contracts. But in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, airspace connecting Europe to Asia has been significantly restricted. At best, that is going to add to costs as airlines try to fly to all corners of the globe, and at worst, it means a cutoff in service to certain regions.
Delta is the U.S. airline with the most exposure to Russia, but the company on Friday suspended its codeshare with Russian national airline Aeroflot. (Codesharing is a common arrangement by which two or more airlines market the same flight, each using its own flight number.)
More broadly speaking, the international recovery was already trailing the domestic travel rebound. The conflict adds a new twist to any forecast for a return to normal, which could mean it will take longer than investors had hoped for these airlines to rebuild their balance sheets.
Throw in the higher oil prices due to the crisis -- fuel accounts for between 20% and 30% of an airline's total cost -- and there isn't much reason for investors to be excited about these companies right now.
Now what
The only reason for buying into airlines right now is a focus on the long term. The industry is unlikely to fly out of turbulence this year, and 2023 is still very much in doubt, but there is good reason to be bullish on long-term travel demand as the world recovers from the pandemic and we see the rising middle class in emerging markets become more mobile.
The International Air Transport Association, an airline trade group, forecasts global travel volume will grow 3.3% annually through 2040.
For those with the stomach to ride out the recovery, Delta in particular looks like a strong choice because of its best-in-class management, competitive cost structure, and international investments. But be forewarned that the recovery will take time, and as we have seen over the past two years, it is hard to predict what challenges lie ahead. There's no reason to rush to buy on Monday's downdraft.

American Airlines (AAL) is planning to return its furloughed workers in a phased manner. ""While pay and benefits will be restored right away, people will be asked to return to the operation in phases,"" the company’s CEO Robert Isom said in the memo seen by Reuters.
Notably, on Monday, Congress passed a $900 billion coronavirus aid package, from which airlines would get $15 billion for payroll support. According to the Reuters report, American Airlines is expected to receive approximately $3 billion from the payroll package. The air carrier has furloughed nearly 19,000 workers since October this year. (See AAL stock analysis on TipRanks)
On Dec. 11, Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy but raised the price target to $20 (29.2% upside potential) from $18. Linenberg believes that airline stocks are fairly valued at current levels given the upswing in share prices over the past several months due to positive developments on the coronavirus front.
Overall, the Street has a cautiously bearish outlook on the stock. The Moderate Sell analyst consensus is based on 5 Sells, 2 Holds and 1 Buy. The average price target stands at $12.75 and implies downside potential of about 17.6% to current levels. Shares have plunged 46% year-to-date.

2495.0,2023-07-05 00:00:00 UTC,JetBlue decides not to appeal American Airlines alliance court ruling,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jetblue-decides-not-to-appeal-american-airlines-alliance-court-ruling,,,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO, July 5 (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O said on Wednesday it will not appeal a U.S. judge's decision in May requiring it to end an alliance with American Airlines Group AAL.O.
The New York-based carrier said it will start unwinding the alliance to focus on its merger with Spirit Airlines SAVE.N.
U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston on May 19 ordered JetBlue and American to end their ""Northeast Alliance,"" saying the partnership ""substantially"" diminished competition in the domestic market. American is the largest U.S. airline by fleet size and low-cost carrier JetBlue is the sixth largest.
American on May 31 announced that it would appeal Sorokin's ruling - a position it reiterated on Wednesday.
The U.S. Justice Department sued in 2021 to undo the alliance announced the previous year. It called it a ""de facto merger"" of American and JetBlue operations in Boston and New York that removed incentives to compete and would end up costing consumers an additional $700 million a year to fly out of the region's busy airports.
The alliance allowed the carriers to coordinate flights and pool revenue. It also was a big piece of American's strategy to compete in the New York market, where it was losing money.
Since the partnership started, American has ceded domestic capacity out of New York to JetBlue. It has allowed American to move away from unprofitable routes while maintaining a presence in New York. The alliance also enables the airline to feed traffic to its global partners who fly into the region.

2277.0,2023-09-11 00:00:00 UTC,"JetBlue agrees to sell Spirit assets in Boston, Newark to Allegiant",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jetblue-agrees-to-sell-spirit-assets-in-boston-newark-to-allegiant,,,"By David Shepardson
Sept 11 (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O said Monday it had agreed to sell all of Spirit Airlines SAVE.N assets at Boston and Newark Liberty airports to Allegiant ALGT.O, as it works to win approval for its tie-up with Spirit.
JetBlue said it had agreed to transfer two gates in Boston, two gates in Newark, and 43 takeoff and landing authorizations in Newark to Allegiant.
In addition, it has agreed to relinquish up to five gates at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to the Broward County Aviation Department, and will work closely with the department to facilitate Allegiant's growth at that airport using these gates, JetBlue said.
The Justice Department, joined by Massachusetts and other state attorneys general, sued in March seeking to block JetBlue's $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit, alleging the deal was ""presumptively illegal"" and would ""lead to higher fares and fewer seats, harming millions of consumers on hundreds of routes."" Trial is set to begin Oct. 16.
The deal would be the biggest in the U.S. airline industry since American Airlines AAL.O and US Airways merged in 2013.
On June 1, JetBlue said it would divest all of Spirit’s holdings at New York LaGuardia to Frontier ULCC.O. Both the Allegiant and Frontier agreements are conditioned on the completion of the JetBlue-Spirit transaction and must get approvals from regulatory and airport authorities.
JetBlue CEO Robin Hayes said the ""divestiture commitment, while not needed to ensure the continued growth of the vibrant ultra-low-cost carrier segment, is aimed at removing any doubt of our commitment to promoting competition.""
JetBlue said in July it would not challenge a U.S. judge's May order that it end an alliance with American Airlines. The decision terminated the three-year-old ""Northeast Alliance,"" which allowed the two carriers to coordinate flights and pool revenue.
JetBlue argued terminating its alliance with American renders ""entirely moot"" the government's objections to its deal to buy Spirit.

April 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street's three main indexes closed lower on Thursday, giving up earlier gains as Federal Reserve officials including Chair Jerome Powell offered further signposting of aggressive interest rate hikes this year.
A half-point interest rate increase will be ""on the table"" when the U.S. central bank meets on May 3-4 to approve the next in what is expected to be a series of rate increases this year, Powell said.
With inflation running roughly three times the Fed's 2% target, ""it is appropriate to be moving a little more quickly,"" Powell added in a discussion of the global economy at the meetings of the International Monetary Fund.
""The market is pricing in, at least, 50 basis points in May and June,"" said George Catrambone, head of trading at DWS Group.
""Powell, and many other Fed speakers, have been saying they want to get to control as quickly as possible, and that is saying to the market that they are going to go aggressively.""
Earlier on Thursday, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said she supports raising the U.S. central bank's target for overnight borrowing costs to 2.5% by the end of this year, but whether or how much further it will need to rise will depend on what happens with inflation and labor markets.
The remarks by Fed officials hijacked initial momentum which the markets received from positive earnings. All three major indexes opened higher, boosted by strong results from heavyweight Tesla TSLA.O and airline operators.
However, gains were eroded through the morning session and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had already reversed course by the time Powell spoke.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 64.41 points, or 1.44%, to end at 4,395.04 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC lost 273.07 points, or 2.03%, to 13,179.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 359.72 points, or 1.02%, to 34,801.07.
Bond yields also breached fresh multi-year peaks. Yields on the two-year U.S. Treasury, the most sensitive to interest changes, hit their highest in three years before coming off slightly. US/
High-growth stocks, including those of Meta Platforms Inc FB.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, fell as investors fretted about how the higher rate environment would impact their future growth potential.
Netflix Inc > slumped for a second day after its quarterly earnings revealed a first drop in subscriber numbers in a decade, with the streaming giant warning of further declines likely.
The forecast prompted William Ackman to liquidate a $1.1 billion bet on Netflix, with the billionaire investor writing the firm's future was too uncertain to hold onto his position.
The broader technology index .SPLRCT was one of the worst sectors on Thursday, as was energy .SPNY despite crude prices gaining. O/R
There were some bright spots though. Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, rose after its results beat Wall Street expectations as higher prices helped it overcome supply-chain chaos and rising costs.
Airline stocks also maintained their recent momentum. United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O and American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O climbed after they predicted a return to profit in the current quarter due to booming travel demand.
Overall, analysts expect S&P 500 earnings growth of 7.3% in the first quarter, compared with the 32.1% rise in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

2307.0,2023-08-28 00:00:00 UTC,US fines American Airlines for keeping passengers on tarmac,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-fines-american-airlines-for-keeping-passengers-on-tarmac-0,,,"By David Shepardson and Paul Grant
Aug 28 (Reuters) - The United States Transportation Department (USDOT) on Monday fined American Airlines AAL.O $4.1 million for unlawfully keeping thousands of passengers on the tarmac for hours, the largest-ever penalty for violating the rule.
Of the $4.1 million assessed, $2.05 million will be credited to the airline for compensation provided to passengers of impacted flights.
USDOT said an extensive investigation by its Office of Aviation Consumer Protection found that between 2018 and 2021, American allowed 43 domestic flights to remain on the tarmac for lengthy periods without providing passengers an opportunity to deplane in violation of the department's tarmac delay rule.
On one of the 43 flights, passengers were not provided with food and water as required. Most delays occurred at Dallas Fort Worth Airport. The tarmac delays affected a total of 5,821 passengers.
“This is the latest action in our continued drive to enforce the rights of airline passengers,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. “Whether the issue is extreme tarmac delays or problems getting refunds, DOT will continue to protect consumers and hold airlines accountable.”
American told USDOT these delays were the result of exceptional weather events, and that the flights represented less than 0.001% of the approximately 7.7 million flights operated by American and its regional partners during the period of 2018 to 2021.
""We have since apologized to the impacted customers and regret any inconvenience caused,"" the airline said on Monday.
The airline said it has committed ""substantial time and resources to improve its performance on tarmac delays.""
While accepting this compromise settlement ""American respectfully disagrees that certain of these tarmac delays warrant enforcement action under the extreme
circumstances presented,"" it added.
In 2016, USDOT fined American Airlines a then record-matching $1.6 million after it found the carrier had allowed a number of domestic flights to remain on the tarmac without allowing passengers an opportunity to get off the plane.
USDOT in January said it planned to seek higher penalties from airlines and others that broke consumer protection rules, saying they were necessary to deter future violations.
The department has fined numerous airlines in recent years, including a $135,000 penalty on British Airways over a 2017 tarmac delay in which it failed to ensure the timely deplaning of passengers.

2245.0,2023-09-25 00:00:00 UTC,First Week of January 2026 Options Trading For American Airlines Group (AAL),AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-week-of-january-2026-options-trading-for-american-airlines-group-aal,,,"Investors in American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the January 2026 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 844 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AAL options chain for the new January 2026 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $12.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.17. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $12.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $9.83 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AAL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $12.76/share today.
Because the $12.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 18.08% return on the cash commitment, or 7.82% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for American Airlines Group Inc, and highlighting in green where the $12.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $15.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.65. If an investor was to purchase shares of AAL stock at the current price level of $12.76/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $15.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 38.32% if the stock gets called away at the January 2026 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AAL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for American Airlines Group Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AAL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $15.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $15.00 strike represents an approximate 18% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 40%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 20.77% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.98% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 50%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 39%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $12.76) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

4011.0,2021-11-26 00:00:00 UTC,Why Airline Stocks Are Tumbling Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-airline-stocks-are-tumbling-today,,,"What happened
A new COVID-19 variant discovered in South Africa has markets rattled, and airline stocks are selling off more than most. Shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), American Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: AAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU), Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ: HA), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) all traded down by as much as 10% in Friday's abbreviated market session.
So what
Airline stocks endured a miserable 2020 as the pandemic brought global air travel to a virtual halt. There's been a gradual recovery in 2021 thanks to the arrival of effective COVID-19 vaccines, but the airlines remain in a perilous state. The industry is still struggling to regain profitability, and most carriers are now saddled with significant amounts of new debt that they took on to carry them through the worst of the slowdown.
Image source: Getty Images.
The last thing those companies need right now is a return to the days of pandemic-necessitated lockdowns and travel restrictions. But this new COVID-19 variant threatens just that. On Thursday, South Africa's health minister announced the discovery of a new variant that seems to be spreading rapidly.
During a briefing on the variant, scientists said it has an unusually high number of mutations, raising fears that current vaccines might be less effective against it. If so, governments worldwide might need to reimpose restrictions similar to those they instituted in the spring of 2020.
Even if such an intense response is found not to be necessary, fears about the new variant are likely to crimp demand for travel, potentially delaying the airline industry's recovery.
Now what
It is important to note that at this point, the experts are just beginning to research this variant, and much about it remains to be discovered. It could be as bad as they fear, or the current COVID-19 vaccines could prove to be largely effective at preventing infections and serious cases. But regardless of whether the available vaccines work on this variant, we've come a long way in our ability to treat and prevent COVID-19, and progress continues on medicines designed to make the virus less lethal.
Panic selling based on headlines is hardly ever a good idea, but this new variant is certainly a risk to the airline recovery. If nothing else, it could push many carriers' return to profitability into 2023 or beyond. The airlines have shown themselves to be more resilient than investors feared, and bankruptcies among U.S. carriers still seem unlikely, even in light of this new risk.
For those who have strong enough stomachs to ride out this period of turbulence, Delta and Southwest are the best choices among airline stocks to recover ahead of the pack and thrive when travel demand eventually recovers. But anyone going Black Friday bargain-hunting on Wall Street should be aware that the airline industry's recovery could be a multiyear process, and even the best names will continue to face sell-offs until we get some more positive news about which direction the pandemic is going.

2036.0,2010-07-23 00:00:00 UTC,ETF Roundup: Emerging Market Bonds for Your Portfolio,AADR,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/etf-roundup-emerging-market-bonds-your-portfolio-2010-07-23,,,"SAN DIEGO (ETFguide.com) - A few new exchange-traded offerings with exposure to emerging market bonds and international stocks have just occurred. Let's analyze them.
Market Vectors Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond Exchange-Traded Fund (NYSEArca: EMLC)
Van Eck Global expanded its ETF lineup by offering a new emerging markets bond ETF linked to the J.P. Morgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets Global Core Index. This benchmark currently has 171 holdings with maturities ranging from one to 30 years. The average yield-to-maturity is 6.8% as of July 1, 2010.
The index currently tracks a selection of bonds issued in local currencies by thirteen emerging market countries representing Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia: Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey. The index is market-cap weighted, with individual country exposures capped at 10 percent to provide more diversification among countries within the index. The fund's net annual expense ratio is 0.49%.
EMLC is the first US-listed ETF designed to offer investors exposure to bonds issued in local currencies by emerging market governments. Van Eck has long been a proponent of emerging markets investing and, as you'll see in the press release, points to the potential for currency appreciation and higher yields in EM countries, relative to their develop counterparts, as part of their thinking behind launching EMLC.
Barclays ETN+ Inverse S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures ETN (NYSEArca: XXV)
Barclays Capital debuted an exchange-traded note or ETN that provides opposite or inverse exposure to stock market volatility. ETNs are typically linked to the performance of a currency or an index. Like bonds, ETNs carry credit default risk of the financial institution issuing them.
'Investors are increasingly looking for diversified ways to access equity market volatility,' said Philippe El-Asmar, Head of Investor Solutions at Barclays Capital. 'We are pleased to provide them with the first exchange traded product that allows them to express a bearish view on volatility.' The annual fees on XXV are 0.89%.
WCM/BNY Mellon Focused Growth ADR ETF (NYSEArca: AADR)
AdvisorShares launched an actively managed international ETF which is sub-advised by institutional money manager WCM Investment Management (WCM.)
The investment objective of AADR is long-term capital appreciation above international benchmarks such as the BNY Mellon Classic ADR Index and the MSCI EAFE Index. AADR will own a large-cap growth portfolio for the non-U.S. universe. The portfolio, which includes developed and emerging markets, is purposely very different from international benchmarks and other international funds. WCM is concentrated on 20-30 holdings and emphasizes traditional growth sectors such as technology, healthcare and consumer staples/discretionary. AADR's annual expense ratio is 1.25%.

543.0,2023-03-14 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa (AA) Stock Sinks As Market Gains: What You Should Know,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-aa-stock-sinks-as-market-gains%3A-what-you-should-know-2,,,"Alcoa (AA) closed the most recent trading day at $44.59, moving -0.27% from the previous trading session. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 1.68%. At the same time, the Dow added 1.06%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.7%.
Heading into today, shares of the bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company had lost 6.76% over the past month, lagging the Industrial Products sector's loss of 5.79% and the S&P 500's loss of 6.68% in that time.
Investors will be hoping for strength from Alcoa as it approaches its next earnings release. On that day, Alcoa is projected to report earnings of $0.04 per share, which would represent a year-over-year decline of 98.69%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $2.65 billion, down 19.55% from the year-ago period.
For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.42 per share and revenue of $10.52 billion, which would represent changes of -49.9% and -15.55%, respectively, from the prior year.

1451.0,2013-01-09 00:00:00 UTC,"Ahead of Wall Street - January 9, 2013 - Ahead of Wall Street",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ahead-wall-street-january-9-2013-ahead-wall-street-2013-01-09,,,"Wednesday, January 9, 2013
The fourth quarter earnings season has started on a positive note, as this morning's report from Constellation Brands ( STZ ) and Tuesday's results from Alcoa ( AA ) and Monsanto ( MON ) show. This is a a more reassuring start than what we saw at this stage in the preceding quarter, perhaps indicating that expectations may have come down enough to make positive surprises easier to come by this reporting season. But it's way too early to make even that modest prediction at this stage as the bulk of the earnings season is ahead of us.
Total earnings are expected to be up +0.5% in the fourth quarter from the same period last year. This is a sharp drop from the +7.9% growth expected in the quarter in late September, just before the third quarter earnings season was getting underway. As was the case in the third quarter (and practically every quarter before that), the actual growth rate will most likely be better than these pre-season expectations, given management teams' mastery of under-promising and over-delivering.
Ahead of the third quarter reporting season, the expectation was for earnings in that quarter to be down -3.4%. While the actual earnings drop turned out to be 'only' -0.1%, it was nevertheless the weakest earnings growth rate in almost 12 quarters. And if the magnitude of outperformance in the fourth quarter is comparable to the last four quarters, then the final growth tally should be in the +2% vicinity. This would mean that corporate earnings were essentially flat in the second half of 2012.
But this sub-par earnings growth trend is not expected to last long or at least that's what current consensus expectations mean. After another quarter of weak results in the first quarter of 2013, earnings growth resumes in the following quarter and ramps up materially in the back half of 2013. I have been skeptical of those growth expectations for a while now, but that's exactly what the market is pricing at present.
Management guidance on the earnings conference calls is always very important, but it will be far more critical this earnings season. Guidance from management teams would frame expectations for the coming quarters. Whether those expectations will hold or come down will depend to a large extent on how management teams describe business conditions on the fourth quarter earnings calls in the coming days.

Nov 15 (Reuters) - UK's FTSE 100 was flat on Monday, as gains in oil major Royal Dutch Shell on plans to ditch its dual share structure were offset by subdued miners hit by global moves to reduce coal use and a big drop in China's steel production.
The blue-chip FTSE 100 .FTSE was unchanged at 0817 GMT, with miners Anglo American AAL.L, Glencore GLEN.L and BHP Group BHPB.L down between 0.7% and 1.2%, after U.N. climate talks ended Saturday with a deal that for the first time targeted fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming.
Data also showed crude steel output in China, the world's top producer of the metal, fell for the fifth straight month in October amid curbs.
On the bright side, Shell RDSa.L gained 1.8% after the energy giant said it will scrap its dual share system in favour of a single class of shares to boost shareholder payouts and simplify its structure.
BT Group BT.L gained 1.8% after Reuters reported citing sources that telecoms tycoon Patrick Drahi is looking to increase his stake in the British company, betting its fibre-optic rollout will boost value.

The S&P 500 is officially out of bear market territory but, in the words of another Fed chairman, this is no time for “irrational exuberance.” The market is still range bound.

Investors now wait for the latest data on inflation and interest rates. They won’t have to wait long. The May consumer price index (CPI) reading comes out on Tuesday followed by the producer price index (PPI) reading on Wednesday. That’s also the day the Fed will announce its decision on interest rates. Investors will also get a read on manufacturing, oil inventories, and at the end of the week the latest read on consumer confidence.

Articles by Jea Yu 
Investors continue to plow money into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. One of the biggest beneficiaries is Samsara, Inc. (NYSE: IOT). This is a company that specializes on developing Internet of Things (IoT) solutions that are powered by AI. As Yu writes, IT stock is up 135% in 2023 and may have higher to go after beating earnings guidance and raising its outlook. Turning his attention to the stickiness of revenge travel, Yu wrote about the state of airline stocks and how investors should think about investing in airline stocks in a post-pandemic world. Yu also wrote specifically about American Airlines Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) which has been a laggard but may be ready to move higher as 2023 revenue surpasses early 2020 levels.  
Articles by Thomas Hughes 
One of the biggest news items this week came when Apple, Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) debuted its Vison Pro AR/VR headset. And while investors are pondering what it may mean for Apple, Thomas Hughes suggests you take a look at a company like GitLab (NASDAQ: GTLB). As Hughes writes, GitLab is “one of the leading AI-powered DevSecOps platform” which will give it many opportunities to increase revenue and market share. If you’re looking for something a little safer, Hughes explains why Verizon Communications, Inc. (NYSE: VZ) has a dividend yield of over 7%, but the stock is far from a yield trap and, in fact, may be too good to pass up. And as many investors may be hitting the road this summer, it’s a good time to check in on a company like Thor Industries, Inc. (NYSE: THO). The company just delivered an earnings report that showed that the floor for RV sales may be higher than analysts expected. Hughes advises investors may want to wait a bit before taking THO stock on a drive, but it does pay a safe dividend if you’re looking for a safe stock for the summer.

The reality of electric vehicles is starting to live up to the promise. And that’s why EV stocks are still relevant to investors with a long-term focus. That was Sam Quirke’s message as he pointed investors to three promising EV stocks for investors to put on their watchlist. None of these companies will threaten Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) for market share any time soon, but now is a time to think about which companies are going to be in that next tier. And speaking of Tesla, Quirke wrote about why the company’s rally within a rally may still have room to run. And while the big tech names are driving the market forward, Quirke was taking a look at three mid-cap stocks that investors probably have not heard of but should. Mid-cap and small-cap stocks tend to lead big rallies, and this may be one of those times.  
Articles by Chris Markoch 
Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG) sent shock waves through the market when it noted that its target consumer was showing signs of distress. But as Chris Markoch writes, the company’s earnings report says more about the state of the consumer than a fundamental flaw with the company which may make it a buy-the-dip candidate for patient investors. And keeping his eye on the dollar store sector, Markoch also wrote about Five Below Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE) that may be heading to an all-time high. The discount chain saw its shares rally as new store openings helped drive up the overall transactions even as the total dollar value of those transactions was lower.  
Articles by Kate Stalter  
Earnings growth is one of the most accurate predictors of stock price growth. And Kate Stalter explains to investors how that narrative is playing out with Shopify Inc. (NYSE: SHOP). The stock is rallying on expectations for earnings growth of 715% in 2023. As Stalter writes, this jump comes after a recent consolidation which is a signal that institutional investors still believe in the stock. Stalter was also looking at two areas of concern for investors: regional banks and real estate. Although concerns still exist about the banking sector, the potential for new capital requirements makes the case for three undervalued regional banks even stronger. And even in the beaten-down real-estate sector, Stalter points out two undervalued real-estate stocks that are offering good value for investors even as their stock price has recently moved higher.  
Articles by MarketBeat Staff 
This week, the MarketBeat staff was on the hunt for stocks that offer value wherever investors may find them. And you might be surprised to find that even at a price tag of over $2,000 a share a stock may offer good value. But that’s exactly the case our staff made for two stocks that have lofty share prices but are still undervalued. The staff also had their eye on a more traditional metric like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in looking at two Dow stocks that offer great value at less than 10x earnings. Investors can even find value in stocks that are cutting their dividend. While this is generally seen as a sign a company is in financial distress, it can also be a savvy, short-term move that will lead to a better tomorrow as is the case for these three stocks who just cut their dividends.

Nov 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes rose on Tuesday as a better-than-feared sales forecast by Best Buy eased worries of a dull holiday season for retailers anxious about consumers turning thrifty due to inflation.
Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N jumped 12.4%, leading gains on S&P 500 .SPX index, after forecasting a smaller drop in annual sales than previously estimated, confident that a ramp up in deals and discounts will lure more customers.

Cliffs is ranked at No. 477 on the list with annual revenues of $4.7 billion for 2010. The company competes with other international mining and natural resources companies like Vale (NYSE:VALE), BHP Billiton ( BBL ) and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO).
We currently have a $102 price estimate for Cliffs Natural Resources stock , about 15% above market price.
Consolidated Deal Secures China Buyers & Added Capacity
Cliffs announced its intention to acquire Canadian rival Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Ltd in a $4.9 billion all-cash deal in January this year. The acquisition was aimed at consolidating Cliffs position as North America's largest producer of iron ore pellets with an added capacity of 8 million tons. Additionally, the deal also gave Cliffs a better foothold on the Asian market by adding Wuhan Iron and Steel, one of China's biggest steel manufacturers, as its customers through existing long-term supply agreements between Wuhan and Consolidated Thompson.
The acquisition decision got shareholder approval in late February, after which it received the necessary clearances from the Canadian and Chinese governments in mid-April and early May respectively. After completing the remaining closing conditions, the deal closed on May 12th - a 4 month period from start to finish.
We estimate that the new assets would contribute to about 8 million tons of iron ore to Cliffs' North American iron ore division in 2012. Capacity upgrades will add as much as 16 million tons of iron ore to the division's sales by the end of 5 years.
The largest producer of iron ore pellets in North America just got larger, officially.

2522.0,2023-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,Brazil's Embraer returns to China with deal for freight conversions,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/brazils-embraer-returns-to-china-with-deal-for-freight-conversions,,,"By Gabriel Araujo
SAO PAULO, June 21 (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer EMBR3.SA is returning to China with a deal to convert passenger jets into freight aircraft with a local partner in the northwestern city of Lanzhou, the company said on Wednesday.
Anticipation of new business in China has been high since President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's trip to China in April. At the time, he publicly backed Embraer's efforts to return to a market where it has struggled to find new business since the 2016 closure of a joint venture in Harbin.
Some had expected a deal for aircraft sales to a Chinese airline. Instead, Embraer announced during the Paris Air Show that it had signed a letter of agreement with Lanzhou Aviation Industry Development Group for 20 E190F and E195F passenger-to-freight conversions.
""It is a market with increasing demand for cargo aircraft to accommodate the tremendous growth of e-commerce trade and the consequent evolution of the logistics industry,"" said Embraer's commercial aviation chief executive, Arjan Meijer.
A day earlier, Embraer announced fresh orders from American Airlines AAL.O and Spanish carrier Binter for commercial aircraft totaling about $1 billion at list prices.
Financial details of the Lanzhou deal were not disclosed.
Embraer said in a statement that the companies intend to cooperate on establishing conversion capability in Lanzhou to boost the introduction of first-generation E-Jet freighters to the Chinese market.
Embraer forecasts demand for such jets to reach 700 aircraft over the next 20 years, with China responsible for 240 of them, and said the deal with Lanzhou was a ""strong indicator"" of such demand.
The Brazilian firm, the world's third-largest planemaker after Airbus AIR.PA and Boeing BA.N, currently has 85 E-Jets flying in China with carriers Tianjin, Hebei, Beibu Gulf and Colorful Guizhou.

JPMorgan traditionally kicks-off earnings season for the financials, generally reporting a day or two after Alcoa ( AA ).
The bank is expected to report earnings of 96 cents per share on revenue of $23.73 billion. Such earnings would be a 24.4 percent sequential dip, and 5 percent drop from the $1.01 in the same period last year. JPMorgan has traded within a range of $27.85 to $48.36 over the last 52-week period.
Shares of JPMorgan plummeted during the quarter, dropping 28 percent to $29.86 at the end of September. The stock is 12 percent better since then, but still down 22 percent on the year.
JPMorgan currently trades at 6.3x fiscal 2012 expectations, compared with 6.1x for Citi ( C ), Bank of America Corp. ( BAC ), and 8.2x at Wells Fargo. JPMorgan is about 25 percent below its book value of $44.80 per share.
Data from Bloomberg has 34 analysts with a Buy rating, four at Hold, and none suggesting to Sell. The Street's price target average is $48.50, with a low of $35 and high of $60.
Around the Street:
Wells Fargo is looking for JPMorgan to report GAAP earnings of 97 cents. Commenting into the quarter, ""We believe that Q3's results face a more difficult environment in most investment banking businesses (similar to its peer UCMBs). We also expect JPM will face continued mortgage-related litigation costs in Q3 - though we are modeling $500MM, down from the $1.2B taken in Q2. We anticipate some weakness in net interest margin and modest loan growth will reduce net interest income by 3% Q3/Q2. Finally we expect mortgage banking revenue of $1.1B will dip modestly from the healthy Q2 performance.""

2792.0,2023-03-22 00:00:00 UTC,Here's Why You Should Retain CSX Corporation (CSX) Stock Now,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-you-should-retain-csx-corporation-csx-stock-now,,,"CSX Corporation (CSX) is benefiting from its solid liquidity as well as investor-friendly steps. However, escalating costs are worrisome.
Factors Favoring CSX
CSX’s cash and cash equivalents were $2,087 million at the end of 2022, much higher than the current debt of $151 million, implying that the company has sufficient cash to meet its current debt obligations.
The company’s commitment to reward its shareholders is encouraging. In February 2023 the company announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 11cents per share. In 2022, CSX rewarded shareholders roughly $5,583 million through buybacks ($4,731 million) and dividends ($852 million).In 2021, the company returned more than $3.7 billion to shareholders through buybacks ($2.9 billion) and dividends (over $800 million).
Key Risk
High costs due to an increase in labor and fringe expenses, purchased services and other, and fuel expenses are limiting CSX’s bottom line. In 2021, total expenses rose 11% year over year due to 12%, 24% and 69% increases in labor and fringe, purchased services and other, and fuel costs, respectively. In 2022, operating expenses increased 27% year over year, mainly due to 78% rise in fuel expenses.
The cost hike in fuel was due to steep rise in highway diesel fuel prices as well as the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking. Costs are likely to be high in the March quarter too.
Zacks Rank & Key Picks
CSX Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation sector are American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL).
American Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is benefiting from the improved air-travel-demand situation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, AAL reported earnings of $1.17 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.63%.
For first-quarter and full-year 2023, AAL’s earnings are expected to register 100.4% and 332% growth on a year-over-year basis.
United Airlines, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, is seeing steady recovery in domestic and leisure air-travel demand. On the back of upbeat air-travel demand, UAL was profitable in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter was the third consecutive profitable quarter at UAL.
Driven by solid demand, management expects total revenue per available seat mile to grow 25% year over year for the first quarter of 2023. Total revenues are anticipated to grow 50% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2023 earnings are expected to surge 227% year-over-year.

About Dashan Huang: Dashan Huang is an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University. His paper ""Twin Momentum"" looked at combining traditional price momentum with improving fundamentals to generate market outperformance. In the paper, he identified seven fundamental variables (earnings, return on equity, return on assets, accrual operating profitability to equity, cash operating profitability to assets, gross profit to assets and net payout ratio) that he combined into a single fundamental momentum measure. He showed that stocks in the top 20% of the universe according to that measure outperformed the market going forward. When he combined that measure with price momentum, he was able to double its outperformance.

4581.0,2021-04-07 00:00:00 UTC,5 Ultra-Popular Stocks to Avoid Like the Plague in April,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-ultra-popular-stocks-to-avoid-like-the-plague-in-april-2021-04-07,,,"We're only a quarter of the way through 2021, but things are looking up for equities. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Q1 higher by nearly 8%, with the benchmark S&P 500 tacking on close to 6%. Considering that the stock market has gained approximately 7% annually, inclusive of dividend reinvestment, throughout history, we look to be on pace for another above-average year of returns.
But as any tenured investor will tell people, an uptrending market doesn't mean all stocks will be winners.
For example, the following five stocks have been exceptionally popular within the investment community, yet all have significant flaws that simply can't be overlooked at their current valuations. These are the companies investors should be actively avoiding like the plague in April.

AMC Entertainment
Since late January, movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE: AMC) has been a primary target of retail investors on Reddit's WallStreetBets chatroom. These predominantly young and novice investors have been focusing on companies with high levels of short interest and attempting to effect a short squeeze. They were successful in doing so two months ago and sent AMC to as high as $20 per share.
But peel back the fanaticism surrounding the Reddit trade, and you'll see that there's actually less substance with AMC than with most other Reddit stocks.
For instance, AMC has a large net debt position and more than $1 billion in cash, according to the company's fourth-quarter operating results. While significantly increasing its share count and issuing more than $400 million in debt capital helped the company stave off bankruptcy in January, it's left AMC with few options moving forward. If shareholders decline to allow the company to sell up to 500 million shares, AMC may not have enough cash to make it through 2022. Meanwhile, if they approve the measure, AMC will likely survive, but shareholders will be drowned by dilution. It's a no-win scenario.
From an operating standpoint, AMC is a long way from even getting back to where it was in 2019. It's facing streaming competition for new film releases from AT&T's WarnerMedia and Walt Disney, and the company is operating at much less than 100% capacity in its theaters. According to Wall Street's consensus, AMC won't be making money until 2024, at the earliest.
With the prospect of a short squeeze not looking so hot, AMC Entertainment should be the No. 1 stock to avoid in April.

Zomedica
A somewhat common theme you'll note on this list are companies that have been targets of the Reddit community. While not all so-called ""Reddit stocks"" are bad news, quite a few stand out for their insane valuations that can't be justified. Clinical-stage veterinary drug and diagnostics developer Zomedica (NYSEMKT: ZOM) is a good example.
Zomedica initially received a boost in January after Tiger King star Carole Baskin was paid to namedrop the company in a YouTube video. A few weeks later, it caught the attention of retail investors, who seem to love penny stocks almost as much as short squeeze opportunities. However, neither of these catalysts offer anything tangible for investors to get excited about.
If there is a marginal positive, it's that Zomedica sold its first-ever Truforma diagnostic system in March, so it's now a revenue-generating company. It also sold quite a bit of stock to raise capital and ease its cash-burn concerns. Nevertheless, Zomedica is valued at roughly 70 times Wall Street's forecasted sales for three years from now, and it's not expected to be profitable anytime soon.
Further, the only way Zomedica was able to ease its cash concerns was by burying its investors in dilution. Since the year began, Zomedica's share count has jumped by more than 305 million. It's not a stock that should be in long-term investors' portfolios.

GameStop
Keeping with the theme of Reddit stocks whose valuations don't make one shred of sense, we have video game and accessories retailer GameStop (NYSE: GME). GameStop was the very first company to gain notoriety for its short squeeze in mid-January. At the time, GameStop's short interest was over 100%.
However, the dynamics of GameStop's short squeeze in January are very different from what we see today. Short interest in the company has declined dramatically, and the company's high daily trading volume would make it easy for short-sellers to exit the stock, should they choose to do so. Without the feeling of being trapped in their positions, any squeeze event in GameStop is going to be very short-lived.
Beyond the primary buy thesis in GameStop being broken (i.e., holding for a short squeeze), the company's operating performance is still mediocre, at best. Though e-commerce sales rose 191% in 2020, the company's total sales declined by 21%, partially because of the closure of 12% of its stores. Even with GameStop laser-focused on promoting digital gaming, its sales will be relatively flat for years and it'll be closing stores in an attempt to backpedal its way into the profit column.
In other words, we're talking about a company whose shares were up 900% in the first quarter that's essentially running in place. GameStop isn't where you want to put your money to work in this market.

Cassava Sciences
Next up is clinical-stage biotech stock Cassava Sciences (NASDAQ: SAVA).
In early February, Cassava released positive clinical data from an interim analysis involving lead drug candidate simufilam as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The open-label study demonstrated improvements in cognition and behavior scores at the six-month mark, with no safety issues noted. With this data release coinciding with the Reddit frenzy, Cassava Sciences stock was sent into the stratosphere.
On a bright note, the company ended February with approximately $280 million in cash after netting almost $190 million in a registered direct share offering. This should give Cassava more than enough capital to fund its research for years to come.
On the other hand, the late-stage outcome for Alzheimer's disease therapies is incredibly poor. Over the past decade, multiple mid-stage treatments have shown promise, only to fall flat in larger blinded studies. In particular, the failure rate for Alzheimer's treatments has been especially high among lesser-known drug developers.
While I'd love to see Cassava succeed, given how terrible Alzheimer's disease is, history suggests it's a longshot to do so. Investors would be wise to invest their money elsewhere in April (and beyond).
Image source: American Airlines.
American Airlines Group
Lastly, investors would be smart to keep their distance from American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) in April.
American Airlines, and airline stocks in general, have been popular companies to buy as part of the U.S. reopening trade. With the U.S. making significant headway on the coronavirus vaccination campaign, the hope is that travel numbers will pick up later this year and perhaps even return to pre-pandemic levels by 2022. This, of course, assumes that enough people choose to get vaccinated, and that variants of the disease don't minimize their effectiveness of existing vaccines.
Even if things go perfectly for the airline industry, it could still be a struggle for American Airlines to survive, let alone thrive. We're talking about a company that's lugging around $41 billion in total debt and over $34 billion in net debt. Between its decision in 2018 to modernize its fleet before it was necessary and the pandemic, American Airlines will likely be constrained by its debt throughout the decade.
What's more, the airline industry requires hefty capital inputs to generate mediocre margins during even the best of times. With bare bones regional airlines willing to undercut majors like American Airlines on price, the future doesn't look promising.

After dealing with the pandemic for more than a year now, travel is on plenty of consumers’ minds. Likewise, investors could be eyeing the top travel stocks in the stock market today, because of this. Now, as most would know, travel stocks are among the key names in the reopening trade. After all, as countries reopen, loosening travel restrictions would follow suit. Additionally, pent-up demand for tourism services from eager tourists would also be another major tailwind for the sector. When you consider these two factors, we could be looking at a perfect storm for the travel industry ahead.
For the most part, when it comes to travel, investors would likely turn to airline stocks or cruise line stocks now. No doubt, companies across both industries are more than eager to facilitate the return of tourism activities as well. In fact, Delta (NYSE: DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) are actively restructuring their holiday flight schedules to account for staffing shortages now. To remedy this, Delta is looking to hire over 1,000 pilots through summer 2022. This would be a strategic move as airline companies continue to report surges in flight ticket bookings.
Meanwhile, cruise line operator Royal Caribbean (NYSE: RCL) is currently halfway through a seven-night voyage via its Celebrity Edge ship. Notably, this marks the first passenger cruise from a U.S. port in over 15-months. If that wasn’t enough, RCL is also preparing for the U.K. summer season at the same time. The company’s Anthem of the Seas vessel is looking to set sail on July 7. Overall, there still seems to be room for the travel and tourism-related sectors to run. Should you feel the same way, here are three top travel stocks to watch in the stock market now.
Best Travel Stocks To Watch This Week
United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: UAL)
Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ: ABNB)
Carnival Corporation (NYSE: CCL)
United Airlines Holdings Inc.
United is an airlines company that is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. It is one of the largest airlines in the world and has 8 hubs. It is a founding member of the world’s largest airline alliance with a total of 28 member airlines. UAL stock currently trades at $52.52 as of 1:16 p.m. ET and has been up by over 25% year-to-date. Today, the company announced an exciting piece of news with Boeing (NYSE: BA).
In detail, United says that it plans to add 200 Boeing 737 MAX and 70 Airbus (OTCMKTS: EADSY) A321neo to its fleet. This would be the largest order in United’s history and also the biggest by a single carrier in a decade. Also, the company will retrofit 100% of its remaining mainline, narrow-body fleet to facilitate the customer experience and create a new signature interior. This would include an approximately 75% increase in premium seats per North American departure, larger overhead bins, seatback entertainment in every seat, and a wide array of other benefits.
In early June, the company also launched a new corporate venture fund, United Airlines Ventures. The venture fund will allow the airline to continue investing in emerging companies that have the potential to influence the future of travel. The new fund will concentrate on sustainability concepts that will complement United’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. This is an impressive goal considering that the company will not rely on traditional carbon offsets. The new funds could help revolutionary aerospace developments and innovative technologies that would ultimately create value for United’s customers and operations. For these reasons, is UAL stock worth watching today?

In essence, the company operates its online marketplace for lodging which primarily includes homestays for vacation rentals and other tourism activities. Impressively, the company says it has connected 4 million Hosts to over 800 million guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. ABNB stock currently trades at $147.96 as of 1:16 p.m. ET.
Last month, the company announced its first-quarter financials and showed major signs of recovery based on the economy reopening and improving travel trends. For instance, the company reported 64.4 million bookings for the quarter, a 13% increase year-over-year. Gross booking value (GBV) was $10.3 billion for the quarter, a 52% increase year-over-year. Revenue for the quarter was $887 million, a 5% increase year-over-year. Airbnb says that its business model is adaptable, and its business has rebounded faster than expected.
Last month, the company announced over 100 comprehensive upgrades to refine and improve its operations. This would include its website and mobile app to its community support and policies. Among the features added would be to give guests even more flexibility when planning their travel and to make it simple for anyone who wants to be a Host. “We are seeing three fundamental shifts in travel as people become less tethered and more flexible,” said Brian Chesky, Co-Founder, and CEO of Airbnb. “People can travel anytime, they are traveling to more places and they are staying longer. The lines between travel, living, and working are blurring and we are upgrading our service to make it easier for people to integrate travel into their lives, and for more people to become Hosts.” With the excitement surrounding the company, will you consider buying ABNB stock?

4 Top EV Charging Stocks To Watch This Week

Carnival Corporation
Topping off our list today is the Carnival Corporation. In short, it is one of the biggest names in the leisure travel industry globally today. As such, it would make sense then that CCL stock is among the top travel stocks to know today. For some context, Carnival’s industry-leading cruise line portfolio consists of nine brands. The likes of which offer consumers sailing experiences across all seven continents. As travel trends eventually pick up the pace, it would not surprise me to see CCL stock following suit. Evidently, the company’s shares have already more than tripled in value since its pandemic-era low. CCL stock currently trades at $25.94 a share as of 1:16 p.m. ET.
If anything, Carnival appears to be pulling out all the stops right now. Namely, Carnival announced plans to sell roughly $500 million in stock, yesterday. This would mark yet another key means of raising capital. After all, Carnival, among other travel industry veterans, is still dealing with pandemic-boosted cash burn rates. As a result, some investors were quick to trim their positions in the company, explaining a 7% dip in CCL stock on Monday. However, a recent update from CEO Arnold Donald may suggest that things appear to be looking up for business now.
According to Donald, demand for Carnival’s cruises is already surpassing pre-pandemic levels. He explained, “Honestly, people are chomping at the bit to cruise again. We do not have an issue with being able to fill the ships.” With Carnival kicking into high gear now, would you consider CCL stock a top watch?

2526.0,2023-06-19 00:00:00 UTC,These 2 Transportation Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-transportation-stocks-could-beat-earnings%3A-why-they-should-be-on-your-radar-3,,,"Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.
We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.
The ability to identify stocks that are likely to top quarterly earnings expectations can be profitable, but it's no simple task. Here at Zacks, our Earnings ESP filter helps make things easier.
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained
The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.
The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction. The Zacks Rank is also factored into the ESP metric to better help find companies that appear poised to top their next bottom-line consensus estimate, which will hopefully help lift the stock price.
When we join a positive earnings ESP with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or stronger, stocks posted a positive bottom-line surprise 70% of the time. Plus, this system saw investors produce roughly 28% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
Most stocks, about 60%, fall into the #3 (Hold) category, and they are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with a #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy) rating, or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market, with Strong Buy stocks outperforming more than any other rank.
Should You Consider United Airlines?
Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. United Airlines (UAL) earns a #3 (Hold) right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.04 a share, just 30 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 19, 2023.
UAL has an Earnings ESP figure of +7.3%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.04 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.77. United Airlines is one of a large database of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
UAL is one of just a large database of Transportation stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is American Airlines (AAL).
American Airlines is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on July 20, 2023. AAL's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.54 a share 31 days from its next earnings release.
American Airlines' Earnings ESP figure currently stands at +6.14% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.46.
UAL and AAL's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.

1665.0,2012-03-05 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa Looks to Hike Prices - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-looks-to-hike-prices-analyst-blog-2012-03-05,,,"According to Reuters, the world's largest producer of aluminum producer, Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) is targeting to hike the prices by 5% for certain coil and flat sheet products. The increased price would be charged for new orders from March 1, 2012.
The price hike would encompass the products like 2xxx and 7xxx HT Coil for coil products as well as Flat Sheet. The company hiked the prices of the alloys in response to their soaring demand in the aerospace industry.
In the recently reported quarter Alcoa reported an adjusted loss of 3 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate profit of 1 cent. Total revenues increased 6% year over year to $6 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at a loss per share of 3 cents.
The company expects global aluminum demand to grow 7% along with a global deficit in primary aluminum supply. It also expects demand to increase from its long-term growth projects in China, Brazil, Australia, Jamaica and Suriname. It expects alumina and aluminum production capacity to increase in these overseas markets.
However, the rising energy and raw material costs are likely to constrain margin expansion, especially caustic soda. Moreover, higher-than-expected input costs or unplanned outages could negatively impact Alcoa.
Currently, the shares of Alcoa retain a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold recommendation). It competes with the likes of Aluminum Corporation of China Limited ( ACH ) and privately held Rio Tinto Alcan Inc.
Based in Pennsylvania, Alcoa Inc. is among the world's leading producers of primary and fabricated aluminum and alumina. It involves mining, refining, smelting, fabricating and recycling of aluminum. The company employs approximately 61,000 people in 31 countries across the world.

1736.0,2011-08-15 00:00:00 UTC,Investing 101: Oversold S&P500 Large Caps with Bullish Option Sentiment,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/investing-101-oversold-sp500-large-caps-bullish-option-sentiment-2011-08-15,,,"(List compiled by Danny Guttridge. Put/Call data sourced from Schaeffer's, all other data sourced from Finviz.)
After seeing several large drops in the market over the past few weeks, there is a lot of uncertainty about the market's direction from here. Volatility is still very high, but there might be some stocks that have seen, or are getting close to seeing their bottom. One way to find these stocks is to screen for a decreasing Put/Call ratio. Let's take a closer look.
Options: Options are contracts that are traded like regular stocks. There are two types of option contracts: Calls and Puts.
In general, buyers of call options believe a stock's price is going to rise, while buyers of put options believe that a stock's price might decline.
A call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock at a certain price at some point in the future. In other words, the buyer of a call option pays a small premium that gives him the right to benefit from potential upside in the future (i.e. he might be able to buy at a lower price, and immediately sell at a profit if the price of the stock rises significantly).
Similarly, a put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a stock at a certain price in the future. If the stock declines sharply, the put option holder can buy the stock at a depressed price, and sell it at the higher price agreed to in the contract.
Put/Call ratio is the total number of put options relative to the total number of call options for a given stock. If there are more put options (a put/call ratio greater than 1), then there are more investors who think that the share price will decrease than there are investors who think that the share price will increase.
To put it simply, a put/call ratio higher than 1 reflects a bearish sentiment about a given stock. A put/call ratio below 1 reflects bullish sentiment about a stock.
Similarly, a rising put/call ratio indicates investor bearishness, while a declining put/call ratio indicates bullishness.
RSI(14) is a technical indicator that measures the speed and magnitude of price movements. It can be used to indicate momentum on a scale of 0 to 100. In general, levels above 70 indicate that a stock is overbought, while levels below 40 signal that a stock is oversold.
Now that you're armed with this knowledge, take a look at this list.
Options traders seem to believe these stocks have hit their bottom, and might be on their way up. Do you agree? Use the list below as a starting point for your own analysis.

Oct 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended higher on Wednesday as investors grew more optimistic that congressional Democrats and Republicans could reach a deal to avert a government debt default.
Top U.S. Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said his party would support an extension of the federal debt ceiling into December. This would head off a historic default that would exact a heavy economic toll.
""McConnell made some dovish comments about temporarily extending the debt ceiling,"" said Jay Hatfield, founder and portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. ""That's going to be interpreted in the short-run as positive.""
McConnell's offer could provide an off-ramp to a months-long standoff between President Joe Biden's Democrats and McConnell's Republicans, who had been expected on Wednesday to block a third attempt by Senate Democrats to raise the $28.4 trillion debt ceiling.
Stocks were lower for much of the session after a strong showing of private jobs in September fueled bets the Federal Reserve could start reining in monetary stimulus soon.

""Positive labor market data comes with the implication that the Fed can tighten policy at a quicker pace. But the fact that hiring is up shouldn't be discounted — it's definitely a good thing in terms of recovery,"" said Mike Loewengart, managing director, investment strategy at E*TRADE Financial.
The more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data is due on Friday. It is expected to cement the case for the Fed's slowing of asset purchases.

4264.0,2021-08-11 00:00:00 UTC,JetBlue launches first London flight despite lingering pandemic,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jetblue-launches-first-london-flight-despite-lingering-pandemic-2021-08-12,,,"By Sarah Young and Tracy Rucinski
Aug 11 (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O started transatlantic flights between New York and London on Wednesday, planning to grab market share with low fares and drive a recovery on what is usually one of the world's busiest and most lucrative international routes.
Transatlantic travel remains partially shut as the United States is still not allowing most travelers from Britain into the country because of the coronavirus pandemic. Anyone who does enter, including U.S. citizens, must present a negative COVID-19 test.
The UK only opened to fully vaccinated U.S. travelers earlier in August.
But New York-based JetBlue pressed ahead with the start of its daily John F. Kennedy (JFK) Airport to Heathrow service, counting on its new Airbus A321LR jets, a longer-range variant of the A321neo, to underpin profits.
Fares for JetBlue's Mint class, which features 24 lie-flat private suites, will start at $1,979 and 999 pounds, significantly cheaper than traditional prices by rivals, while round-trip economy tickets will start at $599 for U.S. travelers.
Speaking at JFK before the first departure, JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes said the launch was already driving a price war, with fares between New York and London falling since its flights went on sale.
""JetBlue is responsible for that,"" he said.
UK-based airlines British Airways ICAG.L and Virgin Atlantic are struggling in the pandemic because unlike U.S. rivals American Airlines AAL.O, Delta Air Lines DAL.N and United Airlines UAL.O, they do not have a large, buoyant domestic market to fall back on.
JetBlue, which plans to add flights to London's Gatwick in late September and between Boston and London next year, was more affected than other U.S. airlines during the pandemic because its hub airports were heavily affected by lockdowns.
As domestic COVID-19 restrictions ease, it has seen an increase in revenues. It hopes its London service will provide a further boost and that it will fare better than other low-cost carriers that have tried and failed to conquer the transatlantic in the past.

744.0,2022-05-18 00:00:00 UTC,Is Trending Stock Alcoa (AA) a Buy Now?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-trending-stock-alcoa-aa-a-buy-now,,,"Alcoa (AA) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.
Shares of this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company have returned -26.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -6.8% change. The Zacks Metal Products - Distribution industry, to which Alcoa belongs, has lost 11.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?
While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.
Earnings Estimate Revisions
Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.
We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
Alcoa is expected to post earnings of $3.66 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +145.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.8%.
The consensus earnings estimate of $13.17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +92.8%. This estimate has changed -7% over the last 30 days.
For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.26 indicates a change of -14.5% from what Alcoa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +111.2%.
With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alcoa.
The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:
12 Month EPS
Projected Revenue Growth
While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.
In the case of Alcoa, the consensus sales estimate of $3.78 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +33.4%. The $14.78 billion and $14.58 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +21.6% and -1.3%, respectively.
Last Reported Results and Surprise History
Alcoa reported revenues of $3.29 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.7%. EPS of $3.06 for the same period compares with $0.79 a year ago.
Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.5 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -5.8%. The EPS surprise was +2.34%.
The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.
Valuation
Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.
Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.
The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.
Alcoa is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.
Bottom Line
The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alcoa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

5 Stocks Set to Double
Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2021. Previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.
Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.

3501.0,2022-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,5 Stocks to Avoid During a Recession,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-stocks-to-avoid-during-a-recession,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The equity markets are facing multiple headwinds in the near to medium-term. There has already been a significant correction in growth stocks in the last few months. However, investors should be selective in accumulating stocks. There are several stocks to avoid during a recession.
A Bloomberg Markets survey indicates that nearly 50% of investors expect a recession in the U.S. in 2023. This seems likely considering the fact that the central bank pursuing contractionary monetary policies. Furthermore, geo-political tensions will have an impact on growth in the coming quarters.
Talking about recession and its impact on sectors, there are broadly two types of goods: luxury and necessity. In a recession, luxury goods tend to witness a sharper decline in demand. Also, industrial commodities and energy prices tend to decline on relatively lower demand.
7 Cheap Growth Stocks That Won't Stay That Way for Long
With this overview, let’s talk about five stocks to avoid during a recession.
LCID Lucid $18.92
FCX Freeport-McMoRan $43.19
CVX Chevron $178.58
AAL American Airlines $16.29
CCL Carnival Corporation $13.55
Lucid Group

I believe that Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) is attractive for the long-term. However, it would be among the stocks to avoid during a recession.
It’s worth noting that Lucid has lowered its production guidance for 2022. That’s one factor that has already depressed the stock. In a recession scenario, the outlook for 2023 might be subdued.
A key reason is that the company’s first model is a luxury car than a car for the mass market. The demand for the car is therefore elastic in nature.
Lucid had initially guided for cash burn through 2024. A potential recession in 2022 or 2023 would also imply cash burn extending beyond this guidance. That’s another reason to be bearish as it would imply equity dilution.
Overall, the electric vehicle industry is positioned for multi-year growth. However, the outlook for LCID stock is bearish in an economic downturn. A sharp correction from current levels would be attractive for accumulation.
Freeport-McMoRan

Over a 12-month period, Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) stock has been sideways. At a forward price-to-earnings-ratio of 9.69 times, the stock looks attractive.
However, in a recession scenario, I would avoid the stock. In general, a recession is associated with a decline in demand for industrial commodities. This is likely to translate into a correction in copper prices and reduced cash flows for Freeport.
It’s worth mentioning here that FCX stock is attractive for the long-term. The global demand for copper will continue to rise with investment in green energy.
Freeport has also utilized higher copper prices and cash flows to deleverage. For Q1 2022, the company reported net-debt of $1.3 billion. Further, the leverage ratio for the same period was 0.1x.
With ample financial flexibility and visibility for increase in copper and gold production, the long-term outlook is positive. Freeport plans $6.2 billion in capital expenditure for 2022 and 2023.
7 Oversold Value Stocks to Buy for June
Overall, Freeport can comfortably navigate any near-term headwinds. FCX stock might however correct if global demand for commodities declines in a recession scenario.
Chevron Corporation

From a fundamental perspective, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is among the top stocks to consider from the oil and gas sector. With higher oil price, CVX has surged by 54% in the last six-months.
However, I would include it among the stocks to avoid during a recession. With the geo-political risk premium, it’s unlikely that there will be a big correction in oil. Even in a recession scenario. Having said that, even if oil declines to $80 per barrel, oil and gas stocks will witness some correction.
Coming back to the positives, Chevron has a strong balance sheet and significant proved reserves. The company’s reserve replacement ratio has also averaged over 100% in the last few years.
With strong operating cash flows, Chevron is positioned to invest in exploration and renewable energy sector. CVX stock also offers an attractive annualized dividend of $5.68 per share. Dividends are sustainable even in a recession scenario.
Overall, CVX stock can correct by 20% from current levels if there is a recession. I would look at any such correction as a buying opportunity.
American Airlines

The travel and tourism industry were impacted due to the pandemic. With vaccinations and decline in infections, air travel has gained traction.
However, in a recession scenario, it makes sense to stay away from airline stocks. Consumers tend to cut down on luxury travel during recession and this factor is likely to impact sentiments.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has declined by 10% for year-to-date 2022. I believe that there is further downside on the cards if there is a meaningful economic slowdown.
I would also avoid AAL stock considering the fact that the company is significantly leveraged. As of Q1 2022, the airline reported total debt of $37.8 billion. The company plans to repay $15 billion in debt by 2025. However, a potential recession can further stress the balance sheet.
7 Overlooked Value Stocks to Buy Before Wall Street Catches On
It’s also worth noting that Brent oil trades above $110 per barrel. American Airlines will have a negative impact on margin due to rising fuel cost. Considering the near-term headwinds, I would avoid AAL stock during a recession.
Carnival Corporation

Another stock from that travel and tourism industry to avoid in a recession scenario is Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL).
An interesting point to note is that even with healthy bookings reported during Q1 2022, CCL stock has continued to trend lower. There are two reasons for this downside.
First, Carnival has a stressed balance sheet and it would take years to reduce the debt servicing cost significantly. In an environment of rising interest rates, the company faces higher debt servicing cost on potential debt refinancing.
Further, with fears of recession, cruise travel might again be impacted negatively in 2023. Additionally, Carnival faces margin pressure due to rising fuel and food cost.
It’s therefore not surprising that CCL stock has declined by 27% in the last six-months. Further, correction would present a good trading opportunity. However, I would avoid any long-term exposure to the stock considering the balance sheet health.

414.0,2023-10-11 00:00:00 UTC,What To Expect From Alcoa's Q3 Results?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-alcoas-q3-results,,,"Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is expected to publish its Q3 2023 results around October 18, reporting on a quarter that saw aluminum prices trend lower. We expect the company’s revenues to come in at about $2.63 billion, marginally ahead of the consensus estimates of $2.59 billion. While this would mark a 2% decline sequentially, it would translate into a year-over-year decline of around 12%. We estimate that the company will post a net loss of about -$0.90 per share, slightly better than the consensus, although this would mark a decline from last year. So what are some of the trends that are likely to drive Alcoa’s results? See our interactive dashboard analysis on Alcoa Earnings Preview for more details on how AA’s revenues and earnings are likely to trend for the quarter.
We note that AA stock has had a Sharpe Ratio of 0.2 since early 2017, which is lower than 0.5 for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. This compares with the Sharpe of 1.2 for the Trefis Reinforced Value portfolio. Sharpe is a measure of return per unit of risk, and high-performance portfolios can provide the best of both worlds.
Aluminum prices have been weak over the last few months, amid improving supply trends, particularly in China, driven by more relaxed power restrictions and new capacity coming online. Moreover, there have been concerns about the real estate market in China, leading to slower demand from the construction sector. That said, the country could be seeing higher investment in the electrical grid and vehicle production. Moreover, orders from the automotive market, particularly in Europe and North America, are likely strong as the semiconductor shortage eased, helping production. While aluminum prices stood at about $2,400 in early April, they have declined since then to about $2,200 per ton currently. This is likely to impact the company’s revenues for the quarter. Separately, Alcoa has seen some delays in getting approvals for bauxite mining in Australia and this has resulted in the company mining for lower bauxite grades from previously approved areas as of Q2. This could also impact results to an extent, as production costs for these grades will be higher. However, the company could see production costs ease a bit for alumina and aluminum as prices for certain inputs such as caustic soda, and calcined petroleum coke ease.
Overall, we still remain positive on AA stock despite the year-over-year decline in the company’s performance. Alcoa stock remains down almost 40% year-to-date and this could be a compelling entry point. Rising investments in the renewable energy sector including electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and solar and wind power plants remain secular drivers for aluminum demand. We think that Alcoa has an edge over other aluminum producers given its strong balance sheet and also due to the fact that its facilities are based mainly in the U.S., resulting in lower energy costs compared to European rivals. We value AA stock at $39 per share, which is well ahead of the current market price of about $29. See our analysis of Alcoa valuation for a closer look at what’s driving our price estimate for Alcoa and how Alcoa’s valuation compares with peers. Also, see our analysis of Alcoa Revenue for more details on how Alcoa’s revenues are expected to trend.

2943.0,2023-01-26 00:00:00 UTC,Chile's Cochilco raises 2023 copper price forecast to $3.85/lb,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/chiles-cochilco-raises-2023-copper-price-forecast-to-%243.85-lb,,,"Adds details
SANTIAGO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - State-owned Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco) on Thursday raised its projection for 2023 copper prices to $3.85 per pound, up from a December estimate of $3.70 a pound, as inventories worldwide drop.
Cochilco also pegged its estimated 2024 copper price at an average of $3.65 a pound.
In a statement, Mining Minister Marcela Hernando said that ""the easing of the zero COVID-19 policy in China; the moderation of North American monetary policy due to the drop in inflation; expectations of a milder than estimated recession in Europe"" help the price of the metal.
The statement also explained that ""historically low inventories and a concern about a lower supply of copper in the market"" contributed to the rise.
A Cochilco report released by Reuters on Wednesday showed that copper production in Chile, the world's largest producer of the metal, will grow at a slower rate during this decade and will also require all projects in the pipeline to materialize.
Cochilco also estimates a global surplus of 160,000 tonnes is expected for 2023 and 360,000 tonnes for 2024, which is equivalent to between two to five days of copper consumption.
""These surpluses would be circumstantial given the positive price projections,"" the report said.

4062.0,2021-11-01 00:00:00 UTC,"U.S. to publish rules on private-sector COVID-19 vaccinations, testing in days",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-to-publish-rules-on-private-sector-covid-19-vaccinations-testing-in-days-2021-11-01-0,,,"By David Shepardson and Nandita Bose
WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The Biden administration said on Monday that a planned rule requiring private-sector employers with 100 or more employees to mandate COVID-19 vaccines or regular testing will be published in the coming days.
The Labor Department said the White House Office of Management and Budget had completed its regulatory review of the rule known as an emergency temporary standard (ETS). The White House said in September the rule would cover more than 80 million private-sector employees.
When the administration will mandate compliance with the new rules is not yet known. Many industries have called for the mandates to be delayed until after the holiday season.
The ETS process was last used in June to institute healthcare workplace rules to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Before that, The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) last ETS was 38 years ago and the government has had a mixed record of success using the fast-track procedure.
The ETS has only been used 10 times in OSHA's 50-year history. Courts have invalidated or halted four of those rules and partially blocked one, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Separately, the White House issued new guidance on Monday to federal contractors after it said last week it was giving them new ""flexibility"" to meet a Dec. 8 deadline for employees to be vaccinated.
White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said he does not expect any disruptions to the U.S. economy or holiday travel as a result of the mandate.
""We’re creating flexibility within the system. There is not a cliff here,"" Zients said last week.
The mandate covers millions of federal contractor employees and companies including Boeing BA.N, American Airlines AAL.O, Union Pacific UNP.N and IBM IBM.N have said they will comply with the contractor mandate.
The new guidance said contractors ""should determine the appropriate means of enforcement"" for employees refusing vaccination who do not have a pending request for accommodation, such as a religious or medical exemption.
The White House said contractors can follow the federal model to address unvaccinated employees that ""encourages compliance, including through a limited period of counseling and education, followed by additional disciplinary measures if necessary. Removal occurs only after continued noncompliance.""
Companies can also use ""its usual processes for enforcement of workplace policies,"" it said
The White House said separately that federal employees ""should not be placed on administrative leave while the agency is pursuing an adverse action for refusal to be vaccinated.""
Federal contractor employees not complying must follow workplace safety protocols for unvaccinated people. Federal agencies can deny entry to unvaccinated contractors to federal workplaces.

May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set to open lower on Wednesday as yet another round of talks between the White House and Republican representatives over raising the debt ceiling failed to make a breakthrough, keeping investors on edge.
The lack of progress in talks to raise the $31.4 trillion borrowing limit ahead of the June 1 deadline has weighed on Wall Street, with its benchmark indexes ending the previous session sharply lower.
Shorter-dated Treasury yields continued to rise, with yields on the 1-month US1MT=RR bond hitting another record high at 5.8920%, as worries about a possible government debt default rise.
""As we get closer to what the perceived deadline of the U.S. running out of cash, markets are going to get way more nervous if the standoff continues,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.
Investors also await minutes from the Federal Reserve's May 2-3 meeting, due later in the day, to assess the central bank's interest-rate path.
""We're at this inflection point where there's going to be disagreement at the FOMC, and you should probably start to see that show up in the minutes,"" Cox said, adding that policymakers may be torn between fighting inflation and its impact on the economy following the banking crisis.
The Fed had hiked interest rates by 25 basis points in its May meeting.
At 8:37 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were down 122 points, or 0.37%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were down 17.5 points, or 0.42%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were down 69.75 points, or 0.51%.

Urban Outfitters Inc URBN.O jumped 13.5% as the apparel retailer posted upbeat first-quarter results, boosted by strong demand and leaner inventory levels.

1878.0,2010-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,Fear Grips the Market,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fear-grips-market-2010-06-07,,,"On Friday, the stock market fell sharply on two major headlines: Hungary may be the latest contagion victim and a serious economic problem for the rest of Europe, and the U.S. jobs report did not meet expectations.
Stocks entered Friday with two successful days and a gain for the week for the S&P 500 ( SPX ) of more than 1%. But heavy selling throughout Friday ended with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJI ) off 3.15%, the S&P 500 down 3.44%, and the Nasdaq ( NASD ) falling 3.64% for the day. The S&P 500 ended the week with a loss of more than 2%.
The Dow's worst performer was Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT ), off 5.5%. American Express Company ( AXP ) fell 5.06%, The Boeing Company ( BA ) was down 4.68%, Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA ) fell 4.57%, and General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) lost 4.5%. The Dow fell 2% for the week, and closed below 10,000 for the second time in two weeks.
Of the two reports that shocked the market, the real surprise was that Hungarian officials had said that economic conditions were so bad there that a default was not out of the question. And there was talk of yet another possible bailout by the European Union ( EU ) with perhaps more former eastern-zone countries in the wings. In response, the euro closed at a four-year low of 1.1956.
Even though the jobs numbers were not as shocking as the newest EU problem, the report still contributed to the losses since many had been encouraged by the White House's recent optimism over jobs and the economy. But non-farm payrolls, which were expected to show an increase of 500,000, instead increased by only 431,000.
The Wall Street Journal, in its summary of Friday's sell-off opined, ""In part, Friday's market gyrations were caused by a hasty reassessment of a theme many traders had bet on recently -- that the U.S. is a relatively safe place to invest at a time when other countries are still struggling."" But the jobs numbers and the impact of the European situation make everyone reassess the possibility of a double-dip recession.
At the close, the Dow fell 323 points to 9,932, the S&P 500 lost 38 points to 1,065, and the Nasdaq was down 84 points to 2,219.
The NYSE traded 1.6 billion shares with decliners ahead of advancers by more than 9-to-1. The Nasdaq crossed 688 million shares, and decliners there were ahead by almost 8-to-1.
July delivery crude oil fell $3.10 to close at $71.51 a barrel, primarily on the sharp drop of the euro versus the greenback. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE ) fell $1.88, closing at $51.55.
August gold rose $7.70 to $1,217.70 an ounce, but the PHLX Gold/Silver Sector Index (NASDAQ: XAU ) lost 4.15 points, closing at 169.09.
What the Markets Are Saying
In the April 20 Daily Market Outlook , just four days before the market topped, I said, ""With internal and sentiment indicators telling us that the market is now dangerously overbought and the 'Sell in May and Go Away' strategy triggering a sell, it is time to go to cash on all rallies. It doesn't get much better than this, so it will most likely get worse."" I was correct; however, I had no idea that we were facing the worst May since 1940.
So I think it important to emphasize that it wasn't just the trite little saying that blindly encourages some market-timers to liquidate their stock holdings on May 1 that triggered my above recommendation. Despite the method's positive record, it would be unwise to counsel anyone to take an all-or-none approach based on a single strategy.
Instead it was our well-seasoned technical signals, both the internal and sentiment indicators, as well as chart analysis together with the May to September negative record that drove me to conclude that this May could be nasty. A ""perfect storm"" of negative indicators appeared to be descending on the markets. As one friend so generously put it, ""It's better to be lucky than smart.""
Last week, another friend made an interesting quip concerning an often-repeated Wall Street saying, ""The two emotions that move markets are fear and greed."" He said, in his experience, there was but one emotion, and that was fear, saying, ""Fear is the greatest motivator in any circumstance.""
He went on to say that in the stock market it is not greed that drives investors and professional managers to take enormous risks at the top of a market, but fear that they will be left behind. And at market bottoms, it is, of course, fear that even drives long-term investors to liquidate their holdings at the very bottom of a bear market.
Fear has again overcome the stock market with visions of a double-dip recession and contagion in the air. So it is possible that today may start with another early rush to sell, based on Friday's escape to the ""traditional investor ""safe havens"" gold futures and Treasuries.
If the market closes below the February/May lows, we could see a quick plunge to S&P 1,000. But let's not rush into this battle between the bulls and bears. With the CBOE Volatility Index ( VIX ) up 20% last week, it's time to stand aside until we determine the real winner of this conflict.

3504.0,2022-06-06 00:00:00 UTC,Just Three Companies Control 97% of This Growing Market,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/just-three-companies-control-97-of-this-growing-market,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Hello, Reader.  
Dave Gilbert here, Editor of Smart Money.  
Let’s start today’s issue off with a story.  
Two men sitting next to each other on a flight started to chat, as is often the case. Except this is back in 1953, these weren’t just any two men, and their conversation ended up changing an entire industry.  
One man, C.R. Smith, happened to be the CEO of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), which of course was the airline they were flying. The other man was also named Smith, Blair Smith, though they weren’t related. He was a sales executive with International Business Machines (IBM).  
The conversation made its way to the frustrations of the day. Blair was having difficulty making a sale, and C.R. was frustrated with the slow pace of the airline reservations process that relied on manual systems and old-fashioned phone calls. A single reservation could take an hour.  
The two didn’t stop talking when the flight landed. In fact, C.R. took Blair to the reservation center at the airport. And as they say, the rest is history. American Airlines and IBM soon partnered on what would become the beginning of reservation automation.  
Eric Fry: This Is One of the Biggest Megatrends I’ve Seen in My Career  
Now, we can do all of this in mere moments. Remembering that might help ease the stress a little bit when your cursor spins for a few seconds and it seems like forever.  
With Americans eager to travel and numbers on the rise, there may be an investment opportunity in what is now the backbone of the modern online reservation system. A backbone that is controlled by only a few companies…  
Americans Are On the Go 
After grinding to a halt in 2020 amid COVID-19 lockdowns, the travel industry has made a sharp recovery.  
Higher prices don’t seem to be slowing things either. Gasoline is hitting all-time highs, and yet AAA projected 39.2 million people would travel 50 miles or more over Memorial Day weekend. That would be 8.3% more than last year and in line with 2017 levels. (The final numbers aren’t out yet.)  
It bodes well for the rest of the summer, according to AAA Travel Senior Vice President Paula Twidale:  
Memorial Day is always a good predictor of what’s to come for summer travel. Based on our projections, summer travel isn’t just heating up, it will be on fire. People are overdue for a vacation and they are looking to catch up on some much-needed R&R in the coming months. 
Same for air travel. According to Hopper, a travel data software company, average round trip airfares for Memorial Day increased by $28 to $394. And yet, the number of passengers going through TSA checkpoints Friday through Monday increased 28.5% over last year to 8.8 million.  
For perspective, that is also 675% more people passing through checkpoints than Memorial Day weekend of 2020.  
This travel rebound trend is something Eric Fry has watched closely for more than a year. With more travelers come increased related bookings, like hotels, rental homes, and rental cars. And with that comes the potential to make money.  
All of those bookings, whether made by consumer Carl at his computer or Travel Agent Anna at her office, are done online. Here’s a “who’s who” of travel industry websites…  
Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG): Kayak, Agoda, Priceline, CheapFlights, Momondo, OpenTable, RentalCars 
Expedia Group Inc. (EXPE): Orbitz, Travelocity, Hotels.com, TripAdvisor.com, SeatGuru.com, Cheaptickets.com 
Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) 
Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT) 
Marriott International Inc. (MAR) 
Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H) 
And on and on.  
Those websites are the facing pages we see, but for the reservations to be made and the systems to talk to each other, they all must pass through a global distribution system, or GDS for short.  
The Gateway to Reservations… and Profits, Too 
Travel is chaotic enough, but without a GDS it would be unbearable. The GDS allows costumers to find availabilities, make reservations, and pay for them. This is one area Eric has focused his research.  
Here’s a good definition from siteminder.com:  
A GDS is a worldwide conduit between travel bookers and suppliers, such as hotels and other accommodation providers. It communicates live product, price and availability data to travel agents and online booking engines, and allows for automated transactions. 
Only three companies dominate the travel industry’s global distributions systems. Spain-based Amadeus IT Group SA (AMADY) is the largest of the three. It processes about 40% of travel bookings worldwide. Dallas area-based Sabre Corp. (SABR) is No. 2, with a 35% market share. And privately held Travelport is No. 3, with a 22% market share.  
I’ll save you the trouble of adding those up. Together these three make up 97% of all travel bookings worldwide.  
“America’s Top Trader” Says to Make This Move Now  
The companies generate revenues from the volume of transactions, not the dollar value of those transactions. So when travel activity increases, revenues also increase.  
As Eric has pointed out, Sabre, the U.S.-based GDS, recently reported its first profitable quarter in more than two years, while also reporting the highest sales and profit margins since the pandemic struck.  
He also likes the company’s commitment to the future…  
The company has not been simply sitting on its hands during the last year, waiting for the inevitable recovery.  
Instead, it has taken decisive steps to fortify its competitive moat by expanding its client roster and beefing up its industry-leading IT capabilities.  
For example, Sabre has collaborated with Google to migrate its IT infrastructure to Google Cloud. Sabre followed up that initiative by partnering with Google last fall to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technology platform that is an industry first.  
And yet, despite the upbeat results and remarks, the stock has tumbled since the earnings announcement.  
Eric admits that the pandemic and its effects “have dragged on far longer than I initially anticipated. And then, just at the moment the clouds finally seemed to be parting, Russia invaded Ukraine and China imposed new COVID lockdowns.”  
But keeping his eye on the macro trend, which his track record shows is clearly a profitable thing to do, Eric expects Sabre to “flourish anew… once the travel recovery becomes and undeniable reality.”

720.0,2022-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,AA August 12th Options Begin Trading,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aa-august-12th-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the August 12th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new August 12th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $44.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $44.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $44.73/share today.
Because the $44.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.32% return on the cash commitment, or 79.10% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $44.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $45.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.25. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $44.73/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $45.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.11% if the stock gets called away at the August 12th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $45.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $45.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.50% boost of extra return to the investor, or 80.65% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $44.73) to be 65%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

4545.0,2021-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,COLUMN-The stampede to exit coal is a worrying harbinger for LNG: Russell,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/column-the-stampede-to-exit-coal-is-a-worrying-harbinger-for-lng%3A-russell-2021-04-20,,,"By Clyde Russell
LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 20 (Reuters) - A global diversified miner paying to exit its coal assets, and a multi-bil-lion dollar investment by Qatar to reclaim its status as the world's largest producer of liquefied natural gas have more in common than might be visible at first glance.
South32 S32.AX, the Australian commodity producer spun out of BHP Group BHP.AX, is effectively handing over up to $250 million to Seriti Resources to take South African thermal coal operations off its hands.
While it's not unusual for sellers of mining assets to cover rehabilitation costs, the sizeable amount involved shows just how much South32 wanted out of thermal coal - and in effect, just how little the assets are worth.
South32 is one of several major coal miners seeking to exit a business that has become increasingly problematic amid action by environmental activists, concern among shareholders and the withdrawal of financing and insurance for mines viewed as contributing to climate change.
In short, coal mines, particularly those producing thermal coal for use in power plants, are increasingly seen as a millstone around the neck of diversified miners. The latter would prefer to focus on producing commodities seen as essential to decarbonising the world's energy systems.
There isn't a straight line between the rush to exit coal and Qatar's $28.7 billion plan to boost its LNG capacity 40% to 110 million tonnes by 2026, with a potential second-phase expansion to a total annual capacity of 127 million tonnes.
On the surface, such a massive investment in LNG would seem to be a vote of confidence in the future of the super-chilled fuel, touted by proponents as a cleaner-burning alternative to coal.
Still, the LNG business is condemned by opponents as producing enough pollution to still be part of the climate change problem. And Qatar's push to produce more LNG could be view through a more cynical prism: the Gulf nation may be seeking to maximise the revenue from its extremely low-cost natural gas assets while it still can - before decarbonisation does to LNG what it's busy doing to coal.
Qatar is believed to be able to produce LNG at a break-even cost of about $4 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), below the $5 to $8 per mmBtu for new projects in Mozambique, Russia and the United States, and the $7 to $11 for current top exporter Australia for new projects, according to figures from the Boston Consulting Group.
This in effect means Qatar can afford to take the view that even if there is an oversupply of LNG in the future, it will be the last producer standing, and it can monetise its natural gas reserves better than its competitors.
This raises the possibility that the billions of dollars currently being invested in LNG projects in places from Mozambique to Russia to North America may end up facing the same issues coal has right now - writing down the value of assets and struggling to sell them.
COAL EXIT STAMPEDE
Of course, for buyers of distressed coal assets such as Seriti, the opportunity remains to run the acquired mines for many years and sell the coal profitably to South Africa's state-owned energy utility Eskom.
The sale of South32's South African energy coal assets to Seriti is expected to close before the end of the company's financial year, pending government approvals and an agreement with Eskom over coal supply.
The planned sale was first announced in November 2019 with Seriti, a company owned by Black South African investors, initially agreeing to pay 100 million rand ($6.7 million) upfront plus deferred payments based on future cash flows until March 2024, with a ceiling of 1.5 billion rand per year.
These terms have now changed, with the deferred payments scrapped, the purchase price reduced to a token 1 rand and South32 agreeing to pay for rehabilitation and other costs.
If the deal does go through, it will be the latest coal exit by a major mining company, following plans by Anglo American AAL.L to spin off its South African coal assets and exit from its joint venture in Colombia, something BHP is keen to do as well.
Additionally BHP wishes to sell, or spin off, its energy coal assets in Australia, and earlier this year cut the value of its Mount Arthur thermal coal in New South Wales state by up to $1.25 billion, reflecting the market view that such assets have plunged in value.
It's possible the present rush for the exit from coal will be matched by major oil and gas producers making a similar dash to get out of LNG in a few years time.

1905.0,2023-12-04 00:00:00 UTC,Hedge Safely by Opting for Gold ETFs,AAAU,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/hedge-safely-by-opting-for-gold-etfs,,,"Gold, a safe-haven investment during a challenging period, has been trending upward encouraging calls for a surge in the commodity’s price to reach its price peak.
The price of the yellow commodity has been ascending amid rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the increasing probability of the Fed adopting a dovish stance in the coming year. The likelihood of the Fed cutting interest rates in 2024 has resulted in the long-term treasury rates declining, making the commodity more appealing to investors compared to bonds.
Gold Price Projections
According to Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, as quoted on Yahoo Finance, driven by factors like falling real rates, rising cycles and the current geopolitical scenario, the precious metal is estimated to hit $2500 per ounce, surging about 22% from its current price levels.
As per Bank of America, as quoted on Kitco, if the Fed opts for an earlier cut, Bank of America strategists anticipate gold reaching $2,400 per ounce by the end of 2024.
Michele Schneider, partner and director of trading education and research at MarketGauge, as stated in the Yahoo Finance article, estimates gold prices to reach $3,000.
Challenging Macro Backdrop Pushes Gold Prices
As per JP Morgan’s global equity strategy team’s new outlook, the broad market index, the S&P 500, is forecast to decline around 8% by the end of 2024, amid heightened geopolitical and political risks, according to Yahoo Finance.
JP Morgan’s bearish outlook was also supported by Morgan Stanley, which forecasts the S&P 500 to fall to 4,500 at the next year-end. However, Morgan Stanley, unlike JP Morgan, was bullish on the corporate earnings front.
The bearish outlook on the index can prompt investors to take shelter in the precious metal to hedge themselves from the downside.
Wealth Protection During Recession Likelihood
In periods of economic uncertainty, like recessions, gold attracts more investors due to its enduring value. Frequently seen as a safe-haven investment, investing in the yellow metal during volatile periods can prove to be beneficial. As returns on bonds, stocks, and property decrease, interest in gold rises, boosting its value.
Economists at Deutsche Bank expect a mild recession in the first half of 2024, stemming from the U.S. economy consecutively contracting in the first two quarters of 2024 and weakening economic indicators. According to EY, the probability of the U.S. economy sliding into a recession in 2024 is around 50%.
Warren Buffett’s increasing cash reserves, standing around $157 billion, indicates that ‘The Oracle of Oklahoma’ is bracing for a projected economic downturn or even a recession (Read: ETFs in Focus as Buffett's Cash Surge Indicates a Likely Recession).
Value of Greenback Further Helps Gold Prices
Gold prices are inversely related to the value of the U.S. dollar as gold is priced in dollars. A weaker U.S. dollar generally leads to higher demand for gold, pushing its price upward, as it becomes more affordable for buyers holding other currencies.
The increasing probability of the Fed embracing a dovish approach and cutting its interest rates in 2024, has resulted in a weakening U.S. dollar. According to Trading View, U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen about 2.74% over the past month and around 1.46% over the past year.
ETFs in Focus
Investors wanting to hedge themselves against an economic slump, the likelihood of a recession and falling greenback can increase their portfolio exposures in Gold ETFs. Across extended investment periods, gold preserves its purchasing power, outpacing inflation and contributing significant diversification to an investment portfolio due to its historical tendency to have a negative correlation with other asset classes.
Below, we highlight a few funds.

3311.0,2022-08-15 00:00:00 UTC,FAA warns of significant delays at New York area airports,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/faa-warns-of-significant-delays-at-new-york-area-airports-0,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned on Monday airline passengers at New York City-area airports could see significant delays in the evening due to air traffic control staffing issues.
The FAA said ""departure and arrival delays this evening could approach two hours"" at John F. Kennedy (JFK), New York LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports. The FAA also issued a ground stop at LaGuardia set to last until 6:15 p.m.
FlightAware, a flight tracking website, said just over 600 flights at the three airports had been delayed on Monday, 16% of arriving and 11% of departing flights at Newark, about 18% of both arriving and departing flights at LaGuardia and around 15% of both at JFK.
A person briefed on the matter said the staffing issue was related to sick leave. The New York City area has the most congested airspace in the United States.
U.S. airlines have blamed a significant part of the summer travel disruptions, which have impacted tens of thousands of flights, on a lack of air traffic control staffing. In June, an airline trade group said FAA staffing issues were ""crippling"" East Coast traffic.
Rich Santa, who heads the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said in July the FAA needs to do a better job of ensuring adequate staffing to oversee national airspace.
Santa said ""unfortunately, FAA staffing is not keeping up with attrition.""
Acting FAA Administrator Billy Nolen told Reuters in July the FAA was ""on track to hire 1,000 controllers this year."" For 1,500 open positions, the FAA accepted 57,956 applications for review.
Air traffic controllers work in control towers, approach control facilities, or route centers, and are essential for coordinating aircraft traffic between the nation's airports.
The FAA said last month ""airlines’ data show that the vast majority of delays are not due to air traffic controller staffing. Where demand has increased, the FAA is adding additional controllers.""

Growing Google Voice Initiatives
Apart from the recent feature, Google added an intelligent network-switching capability to Google Voice to provide an enhanced calling experience to users.
GOOGL unveiled a feature for Google Voice Standard and Premier customers, wherein Voice users can connect with a Session Initiation Protocol trunk from their telecommunications carrier via certified session board controllers from Oracle, Cisco, Ribbon and Audiocodes. With this initiative, Google aims to add more customers to Google Voice.
Google also introduced the call recording feature, which enables admins to automatically or manually manage call recordings. This capability is currently available for enterprise subscribers.
Additionally, Google added Smart Reply feature to Google Voice for Android users. The feature provides three text suggestions, tapping on them automatically sends messages to the concerned person.
Efforts to Bolster Google Workspace
With the recent initiative, Alphabet added strength to the Google Workspace, consisting of Gmail, Meet, Drive, Calendar, Contacts, Voice and more. Google Workspace continues driving GOOGL’s momentum across organizations demanding productivity and collaboration tools.
Apart from Voice efforts, the company updated Google Meet with picture-in-picture and multi-pinning features to help presenters and attendees stay glued to meetings.
Google updated Google Docs by adding emoji reactions to documents for expressing opinions informally. It also added writing suggestions capability, featuring a purple underline to help users with the tone, style and word choice.
Google rolled out a redesigned Gmail on the web to provide users with an enhanced email experience.
All these endeavors are expected to continuously bolster the adoption rate of Google Workspace, which will likely to drive Alphabet’s top line in the days ahead.

Leisure travelers are taking to the skies again as vaccinations roll out nationwide and pandemic cases decline, which are welcome glimmers of hope for a wide range of travel stocks, including carriers.
As a for-instance, the Transportation Security Administration reported that the number of travelers going through its checkpoints between March 18-24 rose by 160% year-over-year to 9.4 million. But to illustrate just how far we have to go, traffic remains 44% below 2019 levels.

The environment is sufficiently buoyant to justify upgrades on a slew of U.S. airline stocks by a number of analysts. That includes Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg, who says hospitalizations, COVID cases and vaccination rates are ""all trending in the right direction.""
He also is encouraged by the industry's ""nonstop pursuit of numerous initiatives to mitigate the spread of COVID and increase the confidence of the flying public."" The airline industry supports an international contact tracing program, as well as a pilot program of the digital Travel Pass from the International Air Transportation Association that would match itineraries to local COVID testing requirements.
Read on as we look at nine airline stocks with a brighter outlook in 2021. One thing to take into consideration, however, is that airlines have already lifted off in 2021, with the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index up 26% year-to-date. This froth makes the group susceptible to choppy trading on short-term concerns. And not all carriers are created equal; the best airline stocks are flying on far sturdier wings than their peers.
We'll look to identify the strongest candidates, which might be even more attractive on quick dips.

American Airlines
Market cap: $13.6 billion
Analyst ratings: 2 Strong Buy, 0 Buy, 6 Hold, 4 Sell, 7 Strong Sell
Year-to-date performance: 38%
Despite a nearly 40% run-up in American Airlines (AAL, $21.81), shares still trade at a lower valuation than several of its smaller competitors. It remains one of the worst airline stocks of the past three years, off 44% in that time versus a 17% loss for the broader airline index.
And it's not popular among analysts, with a consensus Sell rating, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Sign up for Kiplinger's FREE Investing Weekly e-letter for stock, ETF and mutual fund recommendations, and other investing advice.
Hampering investors' optimism over the past few years has been a hefty debt load that's larger than those of its peers. Fitch Ratings, which downgraded America's senior secured debt ratings from B+ to B in early March, notes that AAL ended 2020 with $41 billion in debt including lease obligations. ""(That) is likely to increase to $45 billion or more by YE 2021, leading to leverage be sustained at levels that constrain the (Long-Term Issuer Default Rating) to 'B-' at least through 2022.
But there was some good news in Fitch's report, too. The credit rating agency removed the company from Rating Watch Negative following several ""positive"" events: American's liquidity improved due to continued federal aid, and the vaccination rollout is expected to lead to a ""meaningful rebound"" in air travel in 2021. That means American is less likely to continue to burn cash for a prolonged period.
At the end of 2020, the carrier had $7 billion in cash and short-term investments plus another $7 billion in federal aid from the CARES Act. To conserve funds, American has frozen share buybacks and dividend payments for now.
Deutsche Bank's Linenberg is in American's small bull camp. In the past, he noted, airlines that did not join economic recoveries were ones with broken business models, insufficient liquidity, and whose operations cannot service their financial obligations. That's not true for American and other airlines the bank covers, he says.
Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi, who rates AAL at Hold, raised his fiscal 2021 and 2022 revenue estimates for American but cut his earnings per share (EPS) estimates for both years. He does, however, mention a bright spot in the carrier's business: its marketing operations.
Carriers and banks partner on co-branded credit cards. Travelers use these credit cards to earn miles. When they redeem the miles for travel, the banks buy miles at a good profit to the carriers. For 2020, American had $1.83 billion in marketing fee revenue from its loyalty program. This compares to Marriott's (MAR) $1.55 billion in net fee revenue in 2020, DeNardi says. And yet, American's marketing business is valued at 16 times 2021-23 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) – a discount to Marriott's valuation.

United Airlines
Market cap: $16.9 billion
Analyst ratings: 7 Strong Buy, 2 Buy, 6 Hold, 3 Sell, 2 Strong Sell
Year-to-date performance: 24%
United Airlines (UAL, $53.83) is another so-called legacy U.S. airline with thousands of domestic and international routes. And just like American (and Delta, which we'll discuss in a moment), UAL stands to benefit from a recovery in air travel, especially in business and international flights.
But what sets United apart is a knack for keeping expenses down. Morningstar calls United ""the lowest unit cost legacy carrier since 2016.""
Since the pandemic started, United has been cutting spending and reducing capacity to cope with decreased revenues, says Argus Research analyst John Staszak (Hold). As such, United is ""well-positioned for an eventual recovery in airline traffic."" Management's actions are expected to result in a ""lower daily cash burn rate than that of other legacy airlines,"" he adds.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, United cut its cash burn to $19 million from $24 million a day. For the first quarter, the carrier expects daily cash burn of $10 million to $20 million. United plans to cut another $2 billion in annual costs by 2023. Meanwhile, United's long-term debt stood at around $5 billion at the end of last year.
Here's a growthier goal: United aims to double its loyalty mileage program's EBITDA over the next few years, according to Stifel's Joseph DeNardi, who also rates UAL at Hold. In 2019, EBITDA was $1.8 billion. ""Undoubtedly, that is a far, far more compelling and valuable source of earnings power improvement than (the cost cuts).""
To be sure, United's shares are up 26% year-to-date. But CFRA's Colin Scarola (Buy), who's more bullish than his aforementioned peers, sees more upside to come. ""We are now seeing the leading edge of a large pent-up demand wave,"" he says. He recently raised his 12-month price target to $66 (23% upside), which he pointed out still is a third below the stock's pre-COVID high.
The Street collectively doesn't see UAL as one of the best airline stocks right now, however. Nine analysts give shares some sort of Buy rating, but another six say to Hold and five call it a Sell.

Delta Air Lines
Market cap: $28.8 billion
Analyst ratings: 7 Strong Buy, 3 Buy, 11 Hold, 0 Sell, 1 Strong Sell
Year-to-date performance: 13%
Among the three legacy airline stocks, Delta Air Lines (DAL, $45.61) is seen to have the strongest brand because it is able to attract high-yielding business travelers through product segmentation and credit card partnerships, particularly with American Express (AXP), Morningstar says. Amex pays top dollar for Delta miles that are given to business travelers, who often use mileage to upgrade flights if their employers are unwilling to pay.
And even though a recovery in business travel is challenging for now, Delta is well-positioned once it rebounds.
Delta indicated in its lastearnings callthat most corporate customers expect demand to rebound to 2019 levels by 2023, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth says. Moreover, the increased mobility of employees able to work from anywhere could help business travel return, but perhaps in a different form. Delta is continuing to focus on the corporate and premium leisure traveler, betting that its brand, hubs and sales efforts will give it a competitive edge in the recovery.
Delta's game plan during the pandemic also helps: it focused on serving interior hubs (Atlanta, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Salt Lake City) due to their cost advantages and traffic flow within airports that lowers its dependence on state reopenings. The airline whittled down the number of its focus cities as well, from mid- to high single digits to just two: Austin, Texas, and Raleigh, N.C. These two fast-growing cities have a high concentration of business traffic, Raymond James analysts say. (Focus cities are those where no global or legacy carriers have a hub.)
Delta had $14 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of 2020, versus long-term debt and capital leases of $29 billion. And Argus Research (Buy) expects the carrier to return to profitability in the second half of 2021 and into 2022. Broadly speaking, analysts are warm on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating.

Southwest Airlines
Market cap: $33.7 billion
Analyst ratings: 12 Strong Buy, 4 Buy, 3 Hold, 1 Sell, 0 Strong Sell
Year-to-date performance: 24%
If there's one airline strongly poised to benefit from a recovery led by leisure travelers, it's Southwest Airlines (LUV, $57.70). The largest domestic U.S. airline has made a name for itself by focusing on offering low-cost fares in the leisure market, all wrapped up in a fun package. As business travel recovers, Southwest's low fares could take a share of this market as companies seek to reduce employee travel costs, Morningstar analysts say.
Leisure passenger bookings are improving, and so are the carrier's expectations for March and April operating revenues. The average core cash burn is now seen coming in at $14 million a day for the first quarter, down from the $15 million initially forecast. BofA Securities adds that Southwest has an industry-leading balance sheet and strong competitive position.
They're hardly alone. LUV is one of the best airline stocks of the bunch according to Wall Street's pros, who give it a clean consensus Buy recommendation. Just one analyst is betting against the company at the moment.
""It feels like it's … the beginning of the end,"" Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said in a March 15 interview with The Washington Post. ""There are very clear signs that our business is picking up."" He said he hoped that by June, business will have recovered enough that the airline has a chance of ""breaking even.""
As for business travel, Kelly said it takes five years on average to recover from recessions, although it could be much longer as employees have gotten used to working virtually. (At Southwest, business travel is down 90%.) But Kelly said offering low-cost fares helps the airline do better in such an environment.
LUV is pursuing other revenue streams to offset weakness in business travel. For the first time in 2020, Southwest began participating in other global distribution systems to make it easier for companies to book travel on the airline. Southwest historically has sold its tickets through its down distribution channel. ""So, I would expect our share of (business travel) will go up significantly,"" Kelly adds.

JetBlue Airways
Market cap: $5.9 billion
Analyst ratings: 4 Strong Buy, 2 Buy, 7 Hold, 2 Sell, 1 Strong Sell
Year-to-date performance: 29%
JetBlue Airways (JBLU, $18.79) is another low-cost airline focused on domestic markets with additional perks such as assigned seating and in-flight entertainment. The pandemic that kept travelers at home have hammered JetBlue; nevertheless, a leisure-led travel rebound is helping to lift the airline's wings as well.
""We all want things to get back to normal. I certainly feel optimistic that that time is coming soon,"" CEO Robin Hayes said at the JPMorgan Industrials Conference on March 15. ""We're seeing good revenue momentum. (And while it's right to be a bit cautious), there is a lot of pent-up demand.""
Hayes said JetBlue has ""definitely seen a lot of momentum coming into March."" For example, heading into the month, revenue was about $6 million a day. The average revenue take in March is now around $10 million to $12 million, he says. ""That shows you how much acceleration there has been."" (To break even, JetBlue needs to bring in $13 million to $15 million a day.)
The current uptick in demand is giving Hayes confidence that the airline industry ""can start to be cash positive"" in the short- to medium-term.
Wall Street isn't quite as exuberant. Argus Research's Colin Scarola, for instance, is among a number of analysts calling JBLU shares a Hold on valuation concerns.
""We expect JBLU to breakeven again in Q3 2020, with the help of successful vaccines boosting travel demand,"" he says. ""However, JBLU's debt has more than doubled since December, which will cause earnings to need 4-plus years to fully recover pre-pandemic level, in our view.""

Alaska Air
Market cap: $8.0 billion
Analyst ratings: 9 Strong Buy, 2 Buy, 3 Hold, 0 Sell, 0 Strong Sell
Year-to-date performance: 26%
Wall Street is looking at Alaska Air (ALK, $65.42) with a little bit more favor than other carriers. It has an average recommendation of Buy among 14 analysts, and it's one of the best airline stocks by its composite rating, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
BofA Securities, which has a Buy recommendation on the airline, cited its ""solid"" liquidity position relative to peers and a discounted share price.
""Our recommendations continue to reflect our preference for airlines with solid balance sheets, good relative margins, leisure exposure and the ability to come out of the pandemic in a position of strength,"" says BofA analyst Andrew Didora.
He says momentum continues to drive airline stocks higher in the near term, but he acknowledges there are risks to fundamentals in a recovery ""when most airlines have enterprise values higher than pre-pandemic (times)."" Moreover, jet fuel prices are nearly back to pre-COVID levels, but demand is still more than 60% below – this will affect industry earnings.
CFRA analyst Colin Scarola (Buy) lauds the Alaska Air's conservative balance sheet and its historically high cash generation per plane that ""will make it among the first U.S. airlines to recover profitably this year."" Moreover, he said, the airline has ""modest"" equipment purchase commitments this year and in 2022, meaning it is ""likely to generate meaningful free cash flow"" next year even if earnings remain way below pre-pandemic highs.
Finally, ALK is expected to ""materially"" increase free cash flow beyond next year as air travel demand fully recovers from the pandemic and grows with global economic integration, the analyst wrote.

Spirit Airlines
Market cap: $3.3 billion
Analyst ratings: 4 Strong Buy, 1 Buy, 6 Hold, 1 Sell, 1 Strong Sell
Year-to-date performance: 42%
With bigger competitors cutting fares during the pandemic, Spirit Airlines (SAVE, $34.73) is getting some stiff competition for its budget fares. Demand in February turned the corner later than expected for the no-frills airline, but business caught up in March, allowing Spirit to maintain its business outlook for the first quarter.
Importantly, the upturn in March carries ""favorable implications"" for the second quarter, says Raymond James.
Spirit expects capacity to return to 2019 levels by this summer, which implies a 21% to 24% growth in seats. However, one disadvantage is that Spirit has less room to cut costs than its competitors given its already lean operations. One area of savings, although for the longer term, is the increased use of fuel-efficient next-generation aircraft.
Spirit is what's called an ""ultra low-cost carrier"" (ULCC) with industry-leading low-cost structure that often lets it offer substantially lower airfares than its competitors. It makes around half of its revenue from ancillary sales such as baggage check-in, seat selection and other traditionally included features.
CFRA (Hold) is among several analysts that are cautious on this airline stock. Analyst Colin Scarola cited ""severe"" fourth-quarter 2020 cash burn of $137 million in part as employee compensation costs rose 3% in the quarter from a year ago, compared to a decline of 30% for Southwest and 17% for American Airlines.
Scarola also said Spirit has equipment purchase commitments averaging $830 million for 2021 to 2025 vis-à-vis peak operating cash flow of $551 million before the pandemic.
""We are concerned that Spirit will continue to burn cash for many years,"" Scarola says.

Allegiant Travel (ALGT, $234.70), which operates Allegiant Air, is the little airline that could. And as one of the most profitable carriers in the industry, Allegiant is considered one of the best airline stocks right now, given a high composite analyst rating that includes no Sell calls.
""Not only was the December (2020) quarter loss per share materially narrower-than-expected, but the company managed to post positive adjusted EBITDA of $35 million for 2020, an achievement that very few publicly traded airlines around the world will be able to claim,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg wrote in February. He upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold and raised his 2021 EPS estimates.
Allegiant operates a unique business model in that it views airline seats as commodities that open opportunities to develop related businesses with higher margins that are less capital-intensive: hotel rooms, car rentals and the like. This view has garnered admirers on Wall Street.
CEO Maury Gallagher's vision is ""how every other airline executive should view their business,"" Stifel's Joseph DeNardi (Buy) says.
Like the other airlines, Allegiant sees travel demand improving. But as its competitors retrench from serving cities, Allegiant has expansion on its mind. According to a March 5 note from Raymond James, Allegiant sees around 1,000 potential new markets it could serve, up from 600 it identified before COVID. About 80% of these new markets don't have much competition, and half of them already connect to an Allegiant market.

Mesa Air
Market cap: $445.3 million
Analyst ratings: 1 Strong Buy, 1 Buy, 3 Hold, 0 Sell, 0 Strong Sell
Year-to-date performance: 88%
Mesa Air (MESA, $12.57) is a regional carrier that operates American Eagle, United Express and DHL Express flights.
Mesa is in a good spot after snagging a new United contract prior to COVID and extending its agreement with American for five years, according to a Feb. 17 BofA Securities research note. As such, Mesa is ""well positioned to help its partners capitalize on a return to domestic travel, particularly as the network airlines should focus more on hub traffic.""
Moreover, U.S. government aid was a big support to the carrier, allowing it to refinance high-cost debt. It received more than $140 million in grants and $195 million in loans. ""The government support meaningfully helped Mesa's balance sheet at a time when other airlines were issuing capital to get through the crisis,"" BofA said. As such, ""balance sheet risk has been meaningfully reduced at a time when capex (capital expenditures) needs are small,"" the report added. BofA upgraded the stock to Buy from Underperform.
Looking to the future, Mesa and United recently announced they were investing in Archer Aviation, which develops urban mobility aircraft, or ""flying taxis."" United has ordered 200 of these aircraft, according to a March 4 note from Raymond James. These vertical take-off and landing aircraft can reduce carbon emissions, for example, by up to 50% per trip between Hollywood and Los Angeles International Airport compared to cars. The target cost is $3.30 per passenger mile based on four passengers, making it competitive with ride-sharing, the report said.
""We do not see a near-term benefit to earnings,"" Raymond James analysts say. ""However, potential for electric aircraft to lower pilot training costs and to open up small short-haul markets long abandoned by regional airlines could provide longer term earnings growth.""

682.0,2022-08-18 00:00:00 UTC,COLUMN-Power is the big new problem for industrial metals supply: Andy Home,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/column-power-is-the-big-new-problem-for-industrial-metals-supply%3A-andy-home,,,"By Andy Home
LONDON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Europe's power crunch is taking a rising toll on the region's industrial metals sector, with two more smelters this week announcing plans to halt operations.
Nyrstar NYR.BR will place its Budel zinc smelter in the Netherlands on care and maintenance from the start of September until further notice, while Norsk Hydro NHY.OL will fully power down its Slovalco aluminium smelter in Slovakia by the end of the same month.
More closures will likely follow. Smelting raw materials into refined metal is an energy-intensive process and Europe's power crisis shows no signs of abating and may indeed get worse heading into winter.
It's hot summer weather that's the problem for smelters right now in China though. Drought in Sichuan province has led to power rationing, forcing metals processing plants to curtail output. Lithium operators are included, a warning that the energy transition metals are themselves dependent on existing power availability.
Getting sufficient quantities of minerals out of the ground to meet green demand is challenging enough. Getting enough power to process them into refined metal is now fast emerging as a big new problem for supply.
POWERING DOWN IN EUROPE
Budel is the second zinc plant to close in Europe after Glencore GLEN.L mothballed its Portovesme facility in Italy late last year.
Nyrstar referred only to ""various external factors"" in its decision to shutter Budel but power pricing has to be top of the list. The 315,000-tonne-per-year smelter was already operating at reduced capacity due to soaring power costs, as are both of Nyrstar's still-operating smelters in France and Belgium.
Glencore conceded on its results conference call that its zinc smelting business is barely covering its costs and warned that European power prices pose a significant supply risk to the global zinc market.
Aluminium smelters are even more dependent on affordable power since alumina is transformed into metal by a process of electrolysis.
Slovalco is the fourth European smelter to close over the last 12 months. Alcoa AA.N has taken its San Ciprian smelter in Spain off line for two years while primary smelters in the Netherlands and Montenegro have also come to a halt.
Others such as Romania's Alro have part-idled capacity and all are modulating run-rates to avoid peak usage times.
Western European annualised aluminium production has fallen below three million tonnes for the first time this century with the rising risk that temporary curtailments could become permanent if there is no respite from the energy storm.
The power hit to the region's processing capacity bodes ill for both the European Union's energy transition plans, which will need a lot more metal, and its strategic autonomy drive, which means more of that metal should be mined and refined in Europe.
SHUTDOWNS IN SICHUAN
China's series of extreme heat waves and drought is simultaneously boosting electricity demand and lowering generation capacity in hydro-powered provinces such as Sichuan.
Industrial users across 19 out of 21 cities in the province have been ordered to halt or cut production so power can be prioritised for homes.
Aluminium producers such as Henan Zhongfu Industrial 600595.SS are curtailing output with Shanghai Metal Market estimating the cumulative capacity cuts have reached 395,000 tonnes.
This is a repeat of last year's drought in neighbouring Yunnan province which also led to multiple smelter curtailments in what is an even bigger aluminium production hub.
Sichuan is also a big lithium producer and several local processors are running reduced operations due to power rationing, according to Fastmarkets, which has just lifted its assessment of the local spot carbonate price.
Power rationing is now spreading to other provinces and the pressures on the grid will persist until the heat wave, now in its 65th day, finally breaks.
LIVING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE
Europe's power crisis is a direct consequence of what Russia calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine and the restrictions on west-bound gas supplies.
What's happening in China, however, is a warning that European power availability and pricing might never return to some sort of pre-war normal.
Global warming poses huge challenges for power generation and grid stability, adding to the problems of decarbonising the whole sector. Ironically, green hydro energy is particularly sensitive to changes in weather patterns as Sichuan is finding out.
Temperatures in China have been rising faster than the rest of the world and are expected to continue doing so, according to Yuan Jiashuang, vice-director of China's National Climate Center (NCC).
This poses a significant long-term threat for industrial metals markets since China is the world's largest processor of everything from aluminium to zinc.
NEW DISRUPTOR
The pricing dynamics of metals such as zinc tend to derive from changes in mine output, the costliest part of the production process and the one most prone to unexpected disruption.
The existence of sufficient smelting and refining capacity to treat what comes out of the mines has historically been something of a given. Even if the occasional smelter was retired or closed, China always seemed to have spare capacity to compensate.
Aluminium is something of an exception. Bauxite is plentiful and cheap to mine, meaning smelter output is the key determinant of supply. But smelter outages have historically been rare and largely down to worker stoppages or acts of God such as lightning strikes.
All that is changing. Smelting aluminium or any other industrial metal for that matter is no longer the efficient supply-chain processing channel it used to be.
Power is the Achilles heel of all industrial production plants and all metals are to some extent impacted.
This new disruptor adds an extra layer of complexity to the metals supply picture. Power rationing tends to be localised by its very nature, dependent on specific dynamics such as those in Europe or weather patterns such as drought in Sichuan.
It is manifest in a greater fragmentation of the London Metal Exchange (LME) global reference price and regional physical premiums.
The LME aluminium price has shrugged off the Slovalco news, the market collectively calculating that there is no global shortage of aluminium.
But there is in Europe, where physical buyers are paying more than $500 per tonne over and above the LME price to get their metal. Such a premium was unprecedented until Europe's power problems began to build last year.
Expect more such futures-physical divergence because the metal industry's smelter problems look here to stay.

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning, as well as our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website.
And the information that we're giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again and joining us -- for joining us this morning. And at this point, I'll turn the call over to our chairman and CEO, Doug Parker.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for being on the call. We have a lot to cover today, but I'm going to start with the big news since last quarter's call, at least for me, which is that Robert Isom is going to be the next CEO of American Airlines. That change is effective on March 31. I'm going to remain chairman of the American Board, but importantly, I will have no executive duties.
Robert will be fully in charge. I will stand as chairman for as long as Robert and the board find that of value. This is terrific news for our team. Robert is going to be the ninth CEO in the nearly 100-year history of American Airlines, which we believe is the best job in all of aviation.
And we all are excited for Robert and for American. As you all know, Robert is someone I've worked alongside for several decades. He's an extraordinary team builder who understands the complexities of operating in an airline like American. He loves the people of American, and he brings a fresh perspective to the future of American.
I know he's going to accomplish great things, and I'm looking forward to watching that happen, along with all of you. Now what this transition does mean is this is going to be my lastearnings callwith you all, which is kind of a big deal for me. I've had a speaking role on every quarterlyearnings callsince I became CFO of America West Airlines in June of 1995. So by my calculations, this makes this my 107th consecutive quarterly call.
So I'm going to try not to speak as much on this one as I have on the first 106 calls, especially as it relates to the company's go-forward plans. Rather, I'm going to let those who are leading American into the future to talk about that future. But before I turn over the stage, I do have a couple of quick thank yous. First is to you all, the sell-side analysts and the reporters, who cover our business.
You all have very important jobs covering this crazy industry that we all love, and you do it extremely well. I hope you know I have great respect for what you do and the challenges you face, and I've done my best throughout my career to treat you with the respect you deserve and to give you access in the community you need to do your jobs well. And you've all been extremely fair to me, which I really appreciate. So thank you very much as a blanket thank you to all of you on the line.
It also goes to some of the great people that preceded you, former analysts, like Carl Carros, Candace Browning, Sam Bucket; and former reporters, like Terry Max and Susan Carey, and Scott McCartney. Thank you, all. The second thank you is to the American Airlines team which I can't begin to do adequately on this call, but what I can do to somewhat thank them is to tell you all about the phenomenal job they did in 2021. For the year when growing back to meet a huge increase in demand was the most important and challenging objective for all airlines, the American team grew back faster and further than anyone else.
We served about 25% more customers than any other airline in 2020, which is phenomenal in our industry. The last time in the U.S. airline was that much larger than the next best -- next highest competitor was more than 10 years ago, and that was done by merging two existing airlines, not through organic growth. This growth in 2021 led us to hire 16,000 new team members last year.
We expect to hire another 18,000 in 2022, and our team managed that growth while taking great care of our customers. We posted the best operating performance in our company's history in 2021 with the highest on-time performance and completion factor we've ever had. And we were the second highest to the four largest airlines in all of those metrics, despite the fact we grew back so much further and faster than they did. We're particularly proud of how we ended the year certainly relative to our competitors.
Our team had far more customers than any other airline over holidays, and we did so with much less disruption than our primary competitors. American was the top-performing airline, among all airlines in December in each of the key operating metrics. And as our teams performed as well, our customers have taken note. Our full-year 2021 likelihood to recommend scores were the highest in American history.
That's an incredible testament to our people, who not only show up every day to operate the world's largest airline, but they do so in a way that welcomes back our customers with open arms. And all this translated to our shareholders as well in a year of very difficult stock performance for the industry. American stock increased 19%, far more than any other U.S. airline.
So I want to summarize all this to convey my gratitude to the incredible American Airlines team. And I want to thank each of them on behalf of our customers, our shareholders, and everyone who counts on them every day. It's this performance that gives us great confidence and momentum as we head into 2022 and beyond. So with that, thank you all again.
I'm going to now turn it over to our soon-to-be CEO, Robert Isom, to talk about what lies ahead. Robert?
Robert Isom -- President
Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the entire American Airlines team for their efforts in the fourth quarter and throughout the entire pandemic. And I'd like to reiterate how honored I am to be taking on the role as CEO. I want to express my appreciation for Doug's partnership and friendship over the years.
As you all know, Doug leaves behind an incredible legacy, having opened many doors for our airline and our industry. I look forward to continuing to work closely with him over the coming months to ensure a seamless transition. I'm taking on this role at a very important time for American. Over the past few years, our airline and our industry have gone through a period of transformative change that American has made good use of that time, especially in regard to renewing our fleet, facilities, and network, and making the company as efficient as possible.
For fleet, we have dramatically simplified. We now operate just four fleet types. That gives us operating flexibility, reliability, and efficiency. American's fleet remains the youngest in the U.S.
network carriers. Our aircraft are equipped with industry-leading Wi-Fi, new interiors, and we've added seats to our 737 and A321 fleets, bringing us more in line with the rest of the industry. For facilities, we have expanded the number of gates we operate at our largest hubs in Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte. And we have inaugurated a wonderful new regional concourse at Reagan National, which is historically our most profitable hub.
We've also invested more than $200 million in lounges over the past five years with new Admirals Club lounges opening at Reagan National and LaGuardia. New and upgraded airport spaces are underway in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles as well. And we've also updated maintenance, training, and corporate spaces throughout the system to ensure our team can perform at an even higher level. For network, we're finding more to where our customers want to go.
Our DFW and Charlotte hubs are prime to operate more than 900 and 700 flights per day, respectively. Our partnerships with JetBlue in the Northeast in Alaska and the West Coast allow us to create an industry-leading presence in markets that have historically been difficult for American. And our proposed investments in South American carriers strengthened our already industry-leading position in that region. As demand continues to recover and we return to full utilization of our assets, American is poised to outperform.
We have extracted $1.3 billion of efficiencies, and we're operating an economic fleet that will provide CASM-X tailwinds as capacity is restored. Based on our current assumptions, we expect all of this to result in a return to profitability later this year and continued deleveraging as we pay down $15 billion of debt by the end of 2025. And I'm excited to hit the ground running in April and build on our momentum to deliver results in 2022. So let's get to the business in the quarter.
This morning, American reported a fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $931 million and a full year GAAP net loss of $2 billion. Excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $921 million for the quarter and a net loss of $5.4 billion for the full year. Our results for 2021 were significantly improved over 2020, but the impact of the omicron variant has affected the timing of a full revenue recovery. We delivered a strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter, despite the rise in infections.
We reported fourth quarter revenues of $9.4 billion, our highest for any quarter since the start of the pandemic, and a sequential increase of $458 million from the third quarter. Our cargo team continues to do a fantastic work and delivered record cargo revenues of $1.3 billion in 2021, 30% higher than our previous record. As we've seen throughout the pandemic, each new variance and corresponding increase in cases is followed by a faster recovery of demand with fewer regulatory restrictions and changes in travel policies. Based on what we're seeing, we expect omicron to follow the same pattern.
Bookings are recovering quickly after dropping off considerably in early December, though they're still not back to pre-omicron levels. Leisure travel, particularly in the U.S., and short-haul international market, remains very strong and is approaching a 100% recovery. We expect this trend to continue. And interestingly, we've seen many of our customers that have historically -- we've historically called leisure travelers are actually flying for reasons beyond just vacations.
They may find a feature of a mountain destination, but they're actually going to work remotely for the week. The lines between leisure and business travel are definitely blurry.. The recovery of international and business travel slowed late in the fourth quarter, given the omicron variant, but we remain very bullish on both. The return of international travel is directly linked to travel restrictions around the globe.
As the restrictions fall off, we expect international travel to pick up considerably. We still expect business travel to come back in full, but it will come back in a different way. And by that, I mean the overall mix of business customers, how they travel and how we serve them. As we have shared previously, small and medium-sized business travel remains the strongest segment.
In the fourth quarter, small and medium business travel was roughly 80% recovered, while large corporate travel was only 40% recovered. In addition, small and medium business revenue had sequential month-over-month improvement in December, in spite of the impact of omicron. We're optimistic that as corporate travel returns in a significant way this year and as companies come back more fully into the office and get back on the road, we're going to be back on track. But as we're developing our plans and forecast for this year, we're working to build an airline that can be profitable, even without the full return of managed corporate travel.
The demand environment has changed a lot through the pandemic. Because of this, we have to be nimble and responsive. We have built agile processes that allow us to deliver the network our customers need and want, no matter the environment. The game has changed and our team is ready.
Growing back our network the way we did in 2020 is a feat in and of itself, but to do so while running a reliable operation and achieving strong revenue results along the way make it even more impressive. We entered 2022 with tremendous confidence as a result of the way we finished last year and started the new year. As Doug noted, American had the best reliability of all U.S. carriers in December and the highest annual likelihood to recommend scores in our history.
We're very pleased that 97% of our team has been vaccinated or submitted a request for an accommodation, with no one losing their job. We put creative agreements in place with our union partners to support the operations throughout the pandemic and just recently reached new contract extensions for some of our team members to start the year, all of this while flying more flights and more passengers than any other U.S. carrier by a wide margin. To ensure this momentum continues, we have two sharply focused priorities for this year: running a reliable airline for our customers and returning to profitability.
Returning to profitability is very much tied to the demand and revenue environment. But as I mentioned, the work we have done during the pandemic has positioned us very well. This includes our cost and efficiency actions, which Derek will touch on momentarily, as well as the work that we have done to refocus our network around our most profitable clients. Enhancing our partnerships around the U.S.
and around the world and driving value through the AAdvantage program and co-brand cards has found something that we've done well. And on an absolute basis, new AAdvantage member acquisitions in 2021 outpaced 2019, despite lower level of capacity, and our AAdvantage revenues in 2021 closed in on 2019 revenues. So in summary, we're grateful for the incredible work of the American Airlines team over the past year. We remain optimistic about the return of demand, and we're very pleased with how American is positioned, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team.
And now with that, I'll turn it over to Derek.
Derek Kerr -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I review the results, I would also like to thank the American Airlines team for their outstanding work during the quarter. This pandemic has been relentless. And despite the uncertainty, our team continued to show it's the best in the business.
This morning, we reported a fourth quarter GAAP net loss of $931 million or a loss of $1.44 per share. Excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $921 million or a loss of $1.42 per share. For the full year 2021, we reported a GAAP net loss of $2 billion. And excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $5.4 billion.
Despite the impact of omicron that we saw in this quarter, the trajectory of our revenue recovery continues to be positive, and it even exceeded our initial expectations as we outlined on our last call. Our fourth quarter revenue was down 17% compared with the same period of 2019 versus our original guidance of down 20%. This gradual improvement makes it even clearer to us that despite the uncertain demand environment, the steps we have taken over the past 24 months to bolster our network and improve our revenue-generating capabilities are working. On the cost side, we remain focused on keeping our controllable cost down, and we actioned $1.3 billion in permanent annual cost initiatives in 2021, providing a new and more efficient baseline for our 2022 budget.
During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to invest in the operation with a holiday pay program for our employees, as well as reducing our peak holiday capacity. These actions did put pressure on our unit cost performance in the fourth quarter, but they led to a strong operational performance over that period. This included an industry-leading month of operating performance in December when it mattered the most to our customers. On the fleet side, I'm pleased to report that our fleet harmonization project is now nearly complete, with our last A321 going into the shop this quarter.
This is a full year ahead of our original schedule. We're excited to have this project behind us. In addition to a consistent product and better experience for our customers, the operational benefits of having a simplified and streamlined fleet are already being realized. The changes we have made to our A321s and 737s enable us to fly 2% more total capacity than we could have with the old configuration, thus, providing a unit cost tailwind as we continue to build back our network.
In addition to better unit cost, these reconfigured aircraft will also generate more revenue, allowing us to recover from the pandemic even faster. With respect to our widebody aircraft. We continue to have productive conversations with Boeing to determine the timing of our delayed 788 deliveries that were expected to arrive last year. Due to the continued uncertainty of delivery schedule, these aircraft remains out of our near-term schedule to minimize customer disruption.
We expect to fly four aircraft during our peak summer schedule. We ended the fourth quarter with $15.8 billion of total available liquidity, which is the highest year-end liquidity balance in the company's history. As we have said in the past, the deleveraging of American's balance sheet remains a top priority, and we are committed to significant debt reduction in the years ahead. Even with this volatile demand environment, we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025.
In fact, as of the end of 2021, we have already reduced our overall debt levels by $3.7 billion from our peak levels in the second quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we made $706 million in scheduled debt payments, which resulted in paying off the 2013-1 AATC B-tranche. In the first quarter, we expect to make $337 million of scheduled debt payments, which will include unencumbering 12 aircraft. For our pension, our funded status improved by 9.2 points to 77.9%, resulting in a $2 billion reduction in the underfunded liability on a year-over-year basis.
Lastly, during the fourth quarter, we completed approximately $960 million of AATC financing, and we now have financing secured for all our 2022 deliveries through the third quarter. Our 2022 budget reflects our priorities to run a reliable airline for our customers and return to profitability. Our plan includes ongoing investments that will help build upon the positive momentum we've seen in our operations, while leveraging the cost efficiencies and network enhancements we have talked so much about. We believe these actions will provide a solid baseline for both profitability and free cash flow production when demand has fully recovered.
Looking to the first quarter, COVID-impacted demand and elevated fuel prices will continue to put pressure on our near-term margins. In this environment, we expect our capacity to be down approximately 8% to 10% versus the first quarter of 2019. Based on current demand assumptions and capacity plans, we expect total revenue to be down approximately 20% to 22% versus the first quarter of 2019. We expect our first quarter CASM, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 8% and 10%.
While we expect to be unprofitable on a pre-tax basis in January and February, we anticipate a material improvement and a return to profitability in March as demand returns. As for 2022 capacity, much of our plans are subject to the uncertain timings of deliveries of our 788 aircraft. As I mentioned previously, we moved these aircraft from our near-term schedule to protect our customers. This reduction is worth approximately 1 to 2 points of scheduled capacity for 2022.
With this adjustment, we expect to add back our capacity throughout the year and to have full year capacity recovered to approximately 95% of 2019 levels. This, of course, is subject to the future demand environment, and we always have the ability to adapt, if demand conditions warrant. As we look at our costs, like other airlines, we are seeing inflationary pressures in fuel prices, hiring and training for both new hires and existing crews as we build back our operation, including on the regional side. We are also seeing increased starting wages for certain work groups, including vendors.
In addition, we are seeing unit cost pressures from the rolling 788 delays, as well as the impact from our ramp and mechanic contract that was ratified in early 2020. Even with these unit cost pressures, our fleet simplification strategy enables higher aircraft utilization and higher average gauge, both of which will help alleviate some of these pressures. As such, we expect our full-year CASM, excluding fuel and special items, to be up approximately 5% versus 2019, with the second half of the year much lower than the first half as we fly in more efficient schedule. For the full year, our projected debt maturities are expected to be $2.6 billion.
This includes the cash settlement of our $750 million unsecured notes that mature in June. Without any additional prepayment of debt, we project our total debt will be down $5.4 billion at the end of 2022 versus our peak levels in 2021. With respect to capital expenditures, we expect full-year 2022 capex to be approximately $2.6 billion, which is significantly lower than in previous years and versus others as our fleet replacement needs are complete. Net aircraft capex, including predelivery deposits, is expected to be $1.8 billion, and non-aircraft capex is expected to be $800 million.
So in conclusion. We are incredibly proud of our team for their continued resilience in a very challenging environment. With the bold actions we've taken and steadfast commitment of our team, we are well-positioned for the future. Now before we open up the line to questions, I would like to acknowledge Dan Cravens for a minute.
Today is Dan Cravens' 62nd call, not quite as many as 107, but 67 is pretty amazing, and finalearnings callas part of our American Airlines, US Airways, and America West team. I'd like to personally thank Dan for his two decades of service, his advocacy for both the airline and our investors, and for his friendship. The continuing Dan provided -- or the continuity, excuse me, Dan provided over 20 years in his role across multiple airlines, multiple crisis and a global academic is unmatched.
We wish him the best of luck in his next adventure. We will be introducing Scott Long, who will be stepping into Dan's role from our financial planning organization later this month. So with that, I'd like to open up the line for analyst questions.
Questions & Answers:

Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Jamie Baker with J.P. Morgan.
Jamie Baker -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Hi, good morning. Just quickly, Doug, I love your prepared remarks. I know the point wasn't to make me feel old, but Paul, Candace, Sam, I mean, what a throwback. But it really has been a privilege to speak to you on these calls, all these conferences, all these years.
I did want to just add my own thanks and congratulations. And obviously, same goes to my friend, Dan Cravens. First question, on the traffic liability, Derek. So sequentially, from the third quarter to the fourth, it declined by about $360 million, granted this is less than the customary seasonal decline, but Delta and United both experienced flat sequential trends.
And I'm just trying to understand what the nuances, the puts and takes are, whether it's a network issue, differences in forward bookings. Any additional color on the ATL sequential change?
Derek Kerr -- Chief Financial Officer
No. There's not really any difference, any color. I think, from a stored value basis, though that stayed pretty much the same. Future travel dropped from -- I think we were at 6.4 in total ATL balance, future travel was 3.6, went down to 3.2, which is a normal seasonality for us.
We did see a pickup at the end of the month or at the end of the month from normal buying. So I think it's just normal seasonality for us. And what we didn't see as much as the stored value being used and some additions because, as you know, some of the issues with the cancellations and things that were out there, we added a little bit to that. But I would have expected it to drop even more, but it held up just because of the fact that from an operations standpoint, there were -- we added a little bit in the fourth quarter from issues with the operation.
But other than that, I think it's just seasonality or what we normally see. I'm not sure why others were flat or up other than what they did.
Jamie Baker -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
All right. That's perfect. And just a quick follow-up, and I don't want to get bogged down in comparing your guides to that of United and Delta. But you all expect to arrive at a pretty similar first quarter revenue outcome, down 20-plus points from '19.
But you have to fly considerably more capacity to arrive at that output. Can you just remind us what some of the seasonal and network factors that drive this? I understand there's more seasonality for you in the first quarter, but I'm just trying to figure out what causes that drag.
Vasu Raja -- Chief Revenue Officer
Jamie, this is Vasu. The reality of where we still are in the first quarter is that there's still probably a pretty large variability in first quarter forecast. And so much like Derek, I won't comment on what our competitors are looking at. But we have taken a pretty conservative view of what revenue production will be in Q1.
We've been encouraged by recent trends as case growth spikes. We're already seeing bookings come in stronger so we'll see. But what we see to realize through the pandemic is that we have a lot of levers to go play in the airline really flexibly, and we can shift things up and down and indeed move capacity from one market to another, but more nimbly than we had in times past. And after so many crises, we thought we were nimble before and we got even faster.
So there's still a lot yet to do in the first quarter, and we'll see how things come together as demand start hitting back up.
Jamie Baker -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
OK. That's great. Thank you, gentlemen. Take care.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jamie.
Operator
Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.
Mike Linenberg -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Hey, good morning, everyone. Yes, really to echo a lot of what Jamie said. Doug, it's been a privilege, really. And I've learned a lot going all the way back to the early 2000s, and Dan as well.
Dan, you've been a great friend and you've been a great supporter. And so Scott, you've got some pretty big shoes to fill there.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Mike.
Mike Linenberg -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Just quickly on to questions. I'm sure you're going to get some along these lines. I just want to hit on sort of this G5-ish -- or excuse me, G5, 5G issue. The FA was out, I think, yesterday or two days ago saying something like 62% of the U.S.
fleet is -- should be fine. Where do you guys stack up? And the way we should think about this, is this going to be -- is this going to blow over the next few weeks? Or is this going to sort of reappear five, six months down the road, when maybe some of these exemption zones or buffer zones around airports, maybe there's changes there. Like what should we be concerned about? What should we anticipate as this 5G rolls out over time? Thank you.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. They're asking me to take this one, even though [inaudible] going start very much, Mike, the 5G. This has been like my last assignment. Anyway -- this is look -- and we've all been -- every airline, all CEOs that involve this over the holidays, it wasn't -- anyway, it wasn't our finest hour, I think, as a country to get us to that point.
But the good news is we now have what should have been going on for quite some time, which is the manufacturers, the telecoms, the government agencies all sharing information that they need to make sure that this can be rolled out in a way that all Americans get 5G and all Americans know that their flights aren't going to be impacted by that 5G. So where we sit right now is the way that we're all able to upgrade our fleet is because the telecoms have agreed not to fully deploy some of their towers near airports. So with that agreement, everything is fine. Again, I -- well, I'll turn to David [inaudible].
As far as you'll ever see, everything is totally fine. You see, we don't expect really any material disruption whatsoever as long as that's in place. As against stay in place, we need to get to where they can actually -- and we want to get to where they actually can deploy all the towers they have in place and that we can still do that. But no one's going to make -- no one's going to go do that until we all agree that it can be done without disruption.
So a long way of me saying, it's taken a while to get to the right spot, but I feel like we're in the right spot and the right people to derive information. I don't think you're going to see any material disruption going forward because of this.
Mike Linenberg -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Great. That's what I wanted to hear. And just, Derek, a quick one on the non-op expense, $360 million for the quarter. Because of where your pension is and maybe the potential gains that you're anticipating and how you book it into 2022, is there going to be a pension tailwind not only in the March quarter, but for the year and any sort of rough estimate on what we should use from a modeling perspective? Thank you.
Derek Kerr -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. I think there is a pension tailwind into the year. So if we ended up the quarter $380 million for this quarter. We're projecting it to be in the $350 million range for non-op and slowly declining as we pay off some debt throughout the quarter.
So I would -- first quarter should be more in the $350 million, $360 million range and declining to about the $340 million range in the fourth quarter.
Mike Linenberg -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
That's great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen.
Helane Becker -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Thank you very much, operator. And yes, Doug, it's been really nice knowing you, but hopefully, we'll continue to stay in touch. And Dan, I mean you've been a really good supporter. Actually, your whole team has been a really good support of our conferences over the years.
So thank you very much and best wishes to both of you. And I refused to tell you how many of those conference calls.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I think I know, but thanks, Helane.
Helane Becker -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
No worries. So actually, I guess, I don't know, maybe to Robert. Can you just address two things? There -- you guys have said you're going to hire, I guess, a gross number of 18,000 people this year. And some of those are going to be pilots.
We're seeing United and American -- or Delta, rather, cut regional jet capacity because they don't have enough pilots. Are you going down that similar path? Or are you in a better position from a training perspective?
Robert Isom -- President
kkSo Helane, thanks. It's Robert. Thanks for that question. So we are going to be doing a lot of hiring this year.
We did a lot of hiring as well last year. So from a ton of perspective, we had a couple of years of the pandemic in which, quite frankly, there weren't a lot of people being trained. And given the demand, we -- the capacity in the industry fell by quite a bit. So as we all rebound, of course, there is a constraint that we're all dealing with.
There's not enough production. I do -- of pilot. I do believe that over time that that supply and demand in Palace will be remedied. It's an incredibly attractive profession when you think about the starting wages and the ultimate compensation for the industry.
So we're doing everything that we can, and I know other companies are as well, to encourage those that are looking for a great profession to come into the business. But in the short run, from a mainline perspective, look, we have -- American is a very, very attractive brand. We're going to have plenty of pilots. The biggest issue that we're dealing with is the throughput of pilots and getting them through training.
We've invested an incredible amount of resources and having training assets ready to go. Those are all coming online. And again, from a mainline perspective, we'll be able to supply all that we need. The imbalance is really going to be played out in the regional carriers.
And on that front, like other carriers, we're going to have issues as well. We have them right now. We're working very hard on that. It's impacting us to a certain degree, but we're going to do everything that we can to make sure that it's not a material impact over time.
Helane Becker -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
OK. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow-up question.
I don't know who wants to answer this one. But when you talk about small- and medium-sized businesses and those folks who are traveling, because they really have to, for their livelihood, can you talk about also whether they've got the credit card? And if you're seeing increased credit card acquisition in that category?
Vasu Raja -- Chief Revenue Officer
Helane, this is Vasu, and I'm happy to answer your question. Indeed, this is one of our increasingly fair topics to talk about. You are correct. We see small and mid-market business growth.
But look, the diversity of who that customer is really can't be overstated. Everybody from somebody starting a business to sometimes relatively large companies who are seeing growth through the pandemic and get on the road to drive sales or visit factories or whatever the case might be. And for us, we do very -- we haven't seen growing acquisitions on our co-branded credit cards. Indeed, in Q4, it's not just that our spend level were eclipsed in 2019.
But our acquisitions, even net of attrition, was equal to and very often, for some months and some weeks, greater than what it was in 2019, which means that where people are coming to the card. That said, we see a real opportunity within the space of small business, mid-market business because the reality is we don't actually have a true card product or an entire consumer offering for that segment. A lot of things that we have are either tailored for really large corporate accounts or individual travelers. So we see a lot of opportunity as we come out of this and a lot of ways to go and drive a lot more value to that customer and captured in our P&L.
Helane Becker -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Thanks very much, Vasu. Thanks, everybody.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Helane.

Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.
Duane Pfennigwerth -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you both the same question I asked Gary and Bob at their investor day.
You have worked together for a long time as a team. But from a change perspective, is there any daylight between the two of you strategically? And do you have any examples of issues where you really constructively disagreed over the last decade?
Robert Isom -- President
Hey, Duane. Thanks. I'll start. Look, Doug and I are different leaders, and we definitely go about how we lead the company in different ways.
But I'll tell you that in terms of the strategic direction of American, I've not only worked with Doug, but I've been part of every major decision in this company over the last -- since the merger. And so from that perspective, we're doing the right thing. I'm excited about the positioning of American. The assets that we've put in place, whether it's fleet, airport, alliances, our network, we're ready to go.
As demand recovers and we can put our assets to full utilization, we're poised to outperform. So from that perspective, I don't expect to hear a lot of difference in terms of the way that Doug does these things. But right now, I am solely focused on making sure that we deliver a great product for our customers, and that's running a reliable airline, and getting back to profitability.
Duane Pfennigwerth -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Thanks for that thoughts and appreciate it. It's a tricky question. Maybe one for Vasu. How different would March quarter capacity have been if we never had omicron? Maybe this is an unfair observation, but it feels like Americans' plans relative to the industry are very static in what is obviously a very dynamic world.
Appreciate you taking the questions.
Vasu Raja -- Chief Revenue Officer
Yeah, absolutely, and I appreciate the question. Look, it's sort of hard to do what hypotheticals would be. But what I would say is this. The part of the reason why maybe there's probably less volatility in our schedules is where our airline's sort of naturally positioned.
We -- not only do we operate a lot more of our capacity in domestic, we generate a lot more of value for customers and RASM results from flying in domestic. So for most of the pandemic, certainly the last several months, we've oriented about 85-ish percent of our ASM capacity in the domestic and short-haul operations. As we go in the first quarter, it will be about 80-ish percent in those, with another 5% or so constituting major international markets like one at Heathrow, for example. So for us, so much of our network is there, indeed.
So 65% of our network is in our -- what we call Sunbelt hubs, Phoenix, DFW, Charlotte, D.C., Miami, that have been extremely robust through the pandemic. And any one of those hubs produce unit revenues, which are well in excess of what our competitors do. So a little bit of what you see as a network composition difference, quite frankly. As we go out in the first quarter, quite briefly, we are flying the things where we can most directly create value for the customer and outperform.
And we're not doing the things that don't. So our long-haul schedules are 70% of what they have historically been. Our short-haul schedules are a lot closer to what flat is. So what it would be like when demand is that remains to be seen.
But for us, the real opportunity when we said it all through the pandemic is less about driving volume. And the capacity base, the cost base of the airline changes only very marginally, whether we fly at 95% or 92% of the airline. The really big thing for us is domestic yield performance. And as we look out, I mean, if indeed demand comes back where we see it is less about how we go and manipulate capacity around the system and more about how we capture it in yield growth.
Duane Pfennigwerth -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Appreciate the thoughts.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Duane.

Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.
Hunter Keay -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
Good morning. Robert, as you think about taking over the CEO role, what are some of the things that you want to accomplish in your first 100 days, maybe when your ability to put your stamp on things is at its highest.
Robert Isom -- President
Hunter, I'm going to just be really clear and focused on that. Our goal right now is to get back to profitability as soon as possible to deliver a reliable product, plain and simple. As I take a look forward, we've got a great opportunity ahead of us. And everything come together is the right time.
I do think that we're in a position where demand is poised to react. Everything that we see suggests that there is a pent-up desire for people to get out on the road, whether it's for leisure or business demand. And for that, I think I've got a special opportunity, one that brings together everything that we've been bringing -- working so hard to do throughout the pandemic and bringing that to fruition. So as I take look out to the middle of the year, I do think that we're going to get back to profitability.
I do think that American is going to continue to [inaudible] a very reliable airline, and I think we're going to be very, very competitive in all the markets that we serve.
Hunter Keay -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
OK. And I always -- we talked about capacity being driven by demand and fuel cost occasionally. But what if you're not able to hire people? And what if you're not able to hire the right people that fit the culture that you want to build at American? Is there a decision where you would decide to be smaller as opposed to hiring people that might not be great cultural fits?
Robert Isom -- President
So Hunter, thanks for that question because, look, this is something that I'm really proud of. Last year, as we built back, the entire economy, all industries had struggled with finding the right people, getting them in the right positions. But you know what, American, as we grew back, we really quickly remedied any issues that we had. And what we found is American is a very, very attractive place to work.
American Airlines sells itself in terms of attracting people to it. So whether it's the new flight attendant classes that are now graduating, whether it's the thousands of people that we're bringing on to work in our reservations and agent ranks, and those pilots and mechanics that we're bringing in. We, at American, get a chance to really choose those that get to be part of the team. And that's a great position to be in.
Over time, I think that we're going to have to do a lot of work to make sure that the supply of pilots into our regional carriers as strong as we need it to be. But you'll see us on the forefront of that as well.
Hunter Keay -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst
Thank you.

Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.
David Vernon -- Bernstein -- Analyst
Hey, good morning, everybody, and congratulations on to everybody on their next chapters here. Derek, first question for you on cash flow. If we're looking out at the full-year guidance you've laid out, capex of $2.6 billion, should we be expecting cash from operations to cover that? I'm just trying to get a sense for how secure we should be looking at the balance sheet and the liquidity you have on there. Are we going to be dipping into that from an operating standpoint or are we going to be able cover that based on what you see today?
Derek Kerr -- Chief Financial Officer
We'll definitely be able to cover that.
David Vernon -- Bernstein -- Analyst
Excellent. Short and sweet. I like it. Second question maybe for Robert or Derek, as you look at the capacity and the CASM-X guidance you've given for 2022 down five, up five, how do we think about -- in broad brushes, '22-'23, if we're up a little relative to '19 and is that just going to be kind of a one-for-one thing or is there more abated to that? Like how should we be thinking about the operating leverage coming back into the business as demand gets restored?
Derek Kerr -- Chief Financial Officer
Hey, good morning everybody and yeah. I think exactly what you're saying. I think we are underutilizing our fleet without a doubt at this point in time. I think as we add back our assets, Robert talked about pilot's reportability and making sure the throughput happens and get the throughput through.
So if we had -- and the 7-8, so you have two opportunities to grow this airline at a very cheap cost. I think the cost headwind, there's probably 3 or 4 points of cost headwind we have in place right now with underutilizing our assets and making sure that when those aircraft get back and we can use them as much as we can, we do not need to add costs. We do not need to add aircraft. So we could -- in today's world, we could fly the airline probably 5% more with the cost structure we have today.
So it's pretty close to 1:1. It might be a little bit sticky in there a little bit, but it's pretty darn close to 1:1. The first 5% that we could add back.
David Vernon -- Bernstein -- Analyst
All right. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global.
Dan McKenzie -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
Hey, good morning. Congrats to both Doug and Dan on what an amazing run it's been. It's really been a pleasure. A couple of questions here.
One housecleaning question. Just one follow-up on small- and medium-sized businesses. Vasu, what's factored into the first quarter revenue outlook with respect to the timing of international returning? Are you just sort of straight-lining current trends? Or did you factor in some kind of escalation in March potentially?
Robert Isom -- President
Hey, great question. And you're absolutely correct. We are straight-lining current trends with the low exception of our short-haul business.
Dan McKenzie -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
OK.
Robert Isom -- President
It tends to peak in the March, April time period as North America goes on spring breaks and Easter vacations.
Dan McKenzie -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
OK. Very good. Secondly, just following up on Helane's question on small- and medium-sized businesses. I'm wondering if you can elaborate on kind of their purchase behavior versus a typical leisure traveler.
Do they book further out, closer in? It's presumably higher-margin business. I'm just trying to get a sense of what that means. And I guess I didn't -- in the PowerPoint, I guess, or I didn't catch what that revenue from small- and medium-sized business was as a percent of 2019 revenue, and how you're thinking about that trending potentially here in 2022?
Vasu Raja -- Chief Revenue Officer
Sure. Let me answer those in a slightly different order. First, small business. As we ended December, what we call small- and mid-market business was 80% recovered.
Large corporate business, people who bought on big managed programs, was 40% recovered, ballpark. Interestingly, what that means for us is historically, if 40% of our revenues came from business, about 15 points of that were from large corporates and the balance were from small- and mid-market companies, due to the pandemic that's shifted a lot, where less than 10% comes from managed corporates. As we think about next year, we absolutely anticipate a rebound of business travel, but something where -- something a lot closer to 30 points of the 40 or so is coming from small- to mid-market, and managed corporates come down a little. This is something, which is certainly an opportunity that we look upon very favorably and may, in many ways, be unique to American Airlines because so much of that small business growth, to your question about the profile, does actually book in a very similar booking window as large corporate travel.
So it's a much shorter days to departure than what leisure is. But very critically, it's originating in markets that are in the center of the country, think Oklahoma City or Austin, San Antonio, places like that. It engages in trip behavior, which is very different than managed corporates. People are willing to go stay a Saturday night and fly on a lower-load factor flight.
But very importantly, it comes in at the same level as yield as our large corporate businesses, but a fraction of the cost of sales. The cost of sales looks a lot more like what leisure is. So we see this as a sign of real opportunity. And indeed, as we look out there, and if you think about things, we see that -- to Robert's comments earlier, the nature of this travel is starting to change.
But as we see small businesses traveling, there are more people traveling for blended business leisure purposes. More people willing to go by themselves into a premium fare product when a cheaper one is available. So we see a lot of opportunity as the world changes, and we're going to organize and position ourselves to execute on that.
Dan McKenzie -- Seaport Global Securities -- Analyst
That's terrific. Thanks, Vasu.

Our next question comes from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.
Catherine O'Brien -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hey, good morning, everyone. I just want to echo my peer congratulations to Doug and Dan. It's really been a pleasure working with you the last, I guess, almost 12 years now. Question maybe just on your 2022 growth outlook for that 5%.
I understand that the uncertainty around the 787 just makes it more difficult. But can you share high level what you're thinking the breakout between domestic and international growth is at least on your current 70 assumption? And what's driving the decision on where to allocate that capacity?
Vasu Raja -- Chief Revenue Officer
Yes. This is Vasu. I can help with that. We are -- look, as we see it -- first, this is your first question.
We anticipate that with the 787, we will be a materially smaller international airline than what we would otherwise like to be operating something, which is probably, let's call it, 75% to 85% of the scale we had in 2019. But our short-haul network, domestic and the narrow-bodies we fly into Mexico, Caribbean, Latin America will probably be a lot closer to what 2019 is. But there's a couple of other important things to note there. Of course, first, we have a very conservative view of what happens with the 787s and did a pretty conservative view about how international demand, even recovers through the course of the year.
So a big mix of our international flying, and you don't already see it in published schedules, is oriented around markets where we can go drive a lot of the connectivity through -- whether it's Heathrow or other partner hubs, Doha, things like that that we might not have in times past. The other thing that's out there, too, is to an earlier comment I made. We have a lot more flexibility with the airline. And indeed, through the pandemic, we've come to realize it's much easier -- within a few points, we have a lot of flexibility in how we go and plan the airline.
And so we are consciously trying to build the airlines so that we could be really efficient in how we utilize our assets and make moves around the system. So that we can go fly the markets that customers demand most, even if it's relatively late in the booking curve. So while those are broad strokes of where capacity is, still, things may change. And realistically, they will change as demand comes back.
Catherine O'Brien -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Got it. And then maybe one more for you again, Vasu. Just to dig into your short-term revenue outlook a bit more, I understand there's a lot of moving pieces, but your RASM performance versus '19 improved each quarter through 2021. But it looks like it's going to get worse in the first quarter per your guidance.
Of course, you called out impact of omicron. But can you just help us think through the drivers of that a bit more? And anything we should know about cargo or other revenue trends? Or is that really just your conservative view, as you noted on loads and pricing on the passenger side? Thanks for the time.
Vasu Raja -- Chief Revenue Officer
Look, it's very much the conservative view. And look, having gone through multiple waves of the pandemic, one of the things that we've come to more reliably build forecast on is that the amount of time it takes from the cases peaking to demand recovery. And that's shortened through every wave. In the Delta wave, it was about a seven-week spread between case peaking to demand bottoming out and growing again.
So a lot of our outlook is based on a slightly shortened version of that occurring. But indeed, what we've been seeing as cases a peak, wherever they peaked in the world, Israel, U.K., more recently in domestic, it's not a seven-week span. It's not a four-week span. It's something a lot more like a seven-day span, so it's still early to tell.
As I mentioned earlier, 85% of our capacity is in domestic. And if you presume, last week was the peak of cases across the country. We've been encouraged by the last few days of bookings, but a lot of our first quarter forecast is based on the conservatism that we've had for having seen prior waves before. And indeed, we anticipate that January and February will remain challenged because historically, they are seasonally some of the weakest month in our business.
So we'll see, but we remain encouraged for how strong demand comes back, and we are certainly reserving every seat because there's a customer that wants to travel and want to do soon.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Let's go and move on to the next question.

Our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.
Andrew Didora -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Doug, I just want to extend my congratulations as well, and that the same goes to Dan. It's been a pleasure working with both of you over the years.
Just first question around costs, I guess, Derek, does the 5% CASM guide include anything from current labor negotiations? And then just secondly on costs. When you factor in kind of new labor deals, all the kind of the inflation, and the economy that you were discussing earlier, even as capacity comes back, do you think that getting back to prepandemic CASM-X is a realistic expectation over the next few years?
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. It does not include -- I mean, it includes year-over-year deals that were already done. So any deal that is already done is built in. As Robert talked about, we got some real -- we got some deals done in the past few weeks that weren't huge impact on the cost, but really good opportunity to get those deals done and get them done quick with some of our groups.
But it does not include any new contract negotiations that aren't complete today. So that's number one. Number two, I do think -- we had expected 2022 to get back to 2019 levels. But with the variant and us pulling down the flying from 78s not being there, and also demand not quite being there, we will not get to the 2019 levels.
As we get to 2023, it's definitely possible. It depends on the growth of the airline and other things that we do. If we don't get there, we'll get very close, put it that way. So I think in 2023, we've kind of -- I've always talked about being pretty flat in 2022.
That's not happening really driven by thoughtfully utilizing our assets. As we fully utilize those assets, and we plan in 2023, I think we can get to that level, we're pretty close. We might not get all the way down to 2019, but we'll get pretty close.
Andrew Didora -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Got it. That's helpful. And then just lastly for me for Robert. I guess as you assume the CEO role here, what do you think American needs to do better in, I'll call it, this new world post-pandemic to help drive American's margins back toward pre-pandemic levels? Thanks.
Robert Isom -- President
Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Look, we need to put all the pieces together, all the things that we've been working on over the last three years, and then bring them at that and execute very well. Running reliably for this airline, I know, pays off in terms of unit revenues or price up in terms of unit cost.
And it definitely pays off in terms of customer satisfaction. Again, American has invested in all the right places, when we talk about the aircraft and airports and lounges and whatnot. And that's money that has been spent. It's in place.
And now it's time to bring it back and put it into action. And so we do that. I'm quite confident. As Derek has said, I'm quite confident in all aspects American is poised to outperform.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Andrew.
Operator
That concludes the analysts' Q&A. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal.
Alison Sider -- The Wall Street Journal -- Air Travel Reporter
Hi. I just was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for 787 deliveries. And kind of how confident you are or anything that you're hearing from Boeing about what they might expect in terms of the schedule on that?
Derek Kerr -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Ali, this is Derek. We're still on the same schedule. Mid-April is what we're talking about for our first delivery.
That has been locked in on those dates for probably the last couple of months, and we're still planning on that happening. So we haven't got any different information in the past couple of months, where I think we're still on target for those and that we would take all 13 throughout the year. But we have been conservatively when we put four in the schedule for the summer. We had originally thought we could get all 13 in the summer, but we pulled that down to four.
And we've had really good discussions with Boeing. And I think they're on track as of today to hit that mid-April time frame. And we're hopeful that that's still the case and that nothing else comes up.
Alison Sider -- The Wall Street Journal -- Air Travel Reporter
Got it. And is this something -- is this a situation where you would seek any kind of compensation from Boeing for the delays? Or if there was a further delay, is that something you would discuss?
Derek Kerr -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Yes, we're in discussions with Boeing where we're at. There are delayed penalties that are paid and Boeing is paying the delayed penalties, and everything is happening as we speak today. If there are further delays, and it really does impact the summer much more than what we think it is, then -- we've had good discussions with Boeing that they will compensate us for the losses that we've had for the delay of those aircraft.
Alison Sider -- The Wall Street Journal -- Air Travel Reporter
OK. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Koenig with the Associated Press.
David Koenig -- The Associated Press -- Business Writer
Thanks. Hi, Doug. Well, congratulations as well. I hope you have a great retirement.
And you've mentioned 5G in this week's agreement with Verizon and AT&T. I wondered how long -- do you get a signal of how long they're willing to delay their full rollout? And why did this have to come down to an 11th hour crisis like this?
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, David. We get the sense that they're -- again, the right people are talking to each other, and everyone agrees that it doesn't make sense to deploy any more 5G until we're certain that it's not going to have a disruptive effect on airlines. So again, that's where we stand at this point.
I hope that's where we'll stay. I feel really good about this role will be because, again, the right people are talking to each other. Why it took this long to the right people to talk to each other? I don't know. We can do a post audit later.
I'm not quite certain. Frankly, we are the end user of this dysfunction. It got -- we're the ones affected. Our customers are the ones affected.
And as it was getting ready to be deployed, and we were, therefore, being told what that was going to mean to our operations, we screamed as loud as we could. And fortunately, people listened. So that's where we are today, and what should have happened prior to this is happening now. The technical experts that are working on it tell us it's really not that complicated once they all are able to share information and work on it.
So they seem encouraged that we'll be able to address this in a way that allows for full deployment of 5G, including near airports. I mean, again, with lower levels or whatever is required and also doesn't allow for -- it doesn't require any disruption of air travel. So that's where we are. I don't expect until we get to the point that everyone is really comfortable that that you'll see anything turned on near airports because no one wants to go through this again.
David Koenig -- The Associated Press -- Business Writer
So are the airlines talking directly to the telecoms? Or are you going through the regulators?
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Look, it's much more about the manufacturers, our OEM talking directly to the telecoms, which is happening. So the Boeings, the Airbuses, the Palaces, Honeywell, Collin, etc., talking to their counterparts at AT&T and Verizon, obviously, with FAA involvement. But it's -- what needed to happen is now happening is you needed those organizations, those companies able to talk to each other and share information. Because when we do that, we can get results because people are willing to work together.
We hadn't have that, instead we had government agencies talking to each other, and that's -- that can be less productive.
David Koenig -- The Associated Press -- Business Writer
All right. Thank you.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, David.

Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.
Mary Schlangenstein -- Bloomberg News -- Airlines Reporter
Good morning. Congratulations, Doug and Robert, both. I wanted to ask you if you could talk a little bit about how much of a delay you see the omicron flare-up having on the return to more near-normal travel? One of your competitors said it pushes it out 60 days. But I wonder how that ties in with Vasu's comments about the shortening time between a peak and a bottoming out and then a recovery in demand?
Robert Isom -- President
Hey, Mary. We don't see things a lot different. Look, I think that we were recovering nicely after the Delta variant as we took a look into the Thanksgiving time frame. But then omicron hit, demand dropped off fairly rapidly.
And yes, demand is recovering faster than it had in previous ways. But I think it -- we don't view demand as anything more than delayed. We don't think it's diminished. And if you're taking a look in kind of the one or the two-, three-month time frame of how demand -- the rebound is pushed out, I think that that's the appropriate time frame.
And for us, as Vasu has mentioned, I know Doug earlier said as well, look, as we take a look out in February, especially as we get to current period, we see a lot of demand and a lot of strength in the bookings that we're seeing already. So I do think that as omicron [inaudible], we're going to come out strong.
Mary Schlangenstein -- Bloomberg News -- Airlines Reporter
Thank you. And if I could quickly ask, in discussing increased wage levels going forward and as you try to hire more people, is American contemplating, at all, potentially other unilateral pay increase for unionized workers, either any particular groups or maybe on a more broader basis?
Robert Isom -- President
And Mary, as I mentioned earlier in the call, American has a very attractive brand. We have incredibly generous compensation benefits programs. We attract people right now with the positions that -- and the compensation structure that we have. In various pockets throughout the country, various positions like in regional carriers, we take the appropriate action that we have to.
But I feel really confident in where we are today and what we're contemplating in being able to track the right people in the right numbers and getting in front of it, too.
Mary Schlangenstein -- Bloomberg News -- Airlines Reporter
OK. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Leslie Josephs with CNBC.
Leslie Josephs -- CNBC -- Airline Reporter
Hi. Good morning, everyone. I was just wondering what you guys think the impact is going to be of the multiple labor negotiations you have going on now. You've seen complaints about the issues with quality of life, the schedule changes.
So curious if that changes how you think about scheduling the airline going forward? And what sort of like what Mary was saying with pay increases in 2022 and beyond, how do you see that going?
Robert Isom -- President
Leslie, thanks for the question. Here's the one thing I know is that everybody at American is joined in the goal and objective of running a really reliable airline, one that returns to profitability as soon as possible. And so I know that our labor leaders, our team members, they want a profitable and successful American Airlines as we go forward. So as we take a look into any negotiations, I know that that's a [inaudible] that we're all taking.
It's got -- it has to be a mindset of taking care of our team members certainly, but also making sure we take care of the company and our shareholders. And that's a balance that we've always been able to maintain and will do going forward. So as I think -- I look going forward, as I said before, I know that we can attract team members to American Airlines. And there's ways we can get better.
And by better, it means running an airline that is more reliable, too. And I know everybody is joined in, in that goal.
Leslie Josephs -- CNBC -- Airline Reporter
OK. Thanks. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the 787. Derek, did you say that Boeing is definitely paying compensation now, and they could pay even more if the summer schedule is affected?
Derek Kerr -- Chief Financial Officer
The first answer is yes. I mean, there's delayed penalties that are always in all of these contracts. And Boeing is paying the delayed penalties for each one of these contracts, 320s aircraft. And then the rest of it will be in negotiation as we talk to them.
I mean, hopefully, we don't have to do anything. And hopefully, they hit the schedule that they have, and we don't have any disruption as we go forward. But we've been told from the highest level of the Boeing team that if there is compensation needed to come to the airline, that they're fully abreast to help us and to overcome the cost that the 787 has caused us over these last -- the delay in those aircraft has cost us over the last few years. And that's a negotiation we'll have with the Boeing team.
Leslie Josephs -- CNBC -- Airline Reporter
In addition to what they're already paying for the existing delay?
Derek Kerr -- Chief Financial Officer
Correct.
Leslie Josephs -- CNBC -- Airline Reporter
Got it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from David Slotnick with TPG.
David Slotnick -- TPG -- Senior Aviation Business Reporter
Good morning. And congratulations, Doug. Robert, during your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about a blurring of line between business and leisure travel. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a bit? Does it translate to higher yields, more premium cabin sales, etc.?
Robert Isom -- President
Vasu is going to take this. Go ahead.
Vasu Raja -- Chief Revenue Officer
David, Greg here from you. But yes, we plan to be a really encouraging trend. We do see a blurring of lines where the trip patterns are changing. Thursday, which is still our biggest business day of the week, is also becoming one of our biggest leisure days of the week.
We're having more people who buy business style, fare products, travel as if it's a business trip, but they're going to places, major destinations, Fort Walton Beach, things like that. So that behavior is starting to change. And we can trace the things where people work Fridays remotely or can spend a week or two at a time, working from some place that is not where they live. So all that's creating a lot more variation of how we've historically thought about business and leisure, but in that is a lot of opportunity.
But clearly, as we go through the pandemic, customers have a lot more flexibility with their time. There's a lot more savings that are out there, and travel has always been one of the most aspirational things for U.S. consumers. So we see a lot of that, and we benefit a lot -- from a lot of that in our short-haul network the most.
Our premium cabin sales have been the most robust in places like the Caribbean and leisure destinations in the U.S. more so than they've been and more prototypical business destinations like the Transcon markets or London Heathrow. So we're really encouraged by that trend. We think that it's going to lead to a lot of things.
That's why we have done a lot of things where we are increasingly rewarding travel, which is not just for how frequently people fly but for simply spending on our credit cards or spending all across the airline. And from my earlier comments, we think there's even more to do, which can be really great for our customers and, of course, really great to the airline, too.
David Slotnick -- TPG -- Senior Aviation Business Reporter
Thanks, Vasu. And just as a follow-up. Do you see the impact of inflation leading to anything involved in higher ticket fares, higher prices for customers?
Vasu Raja -- Chief Revenue Officer
Look, it remains to be seen. I mean, this industry has a long history with inflation where it hasn't always bled so cleanly into fares. So we'll see, and we don't make any future commentary about pricing. But it's early to tell and how -- whether this level of inflation stays or not, it's even early to go and guess at that, too.
David Slotnick -- TPG -- Senior Aviation Business Reporter
Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Dawn.
Dawn Gilbertson -- USA Today -- Consumer Travel Reporter
Hi. I got to say, Doug, I'm really jealous. This is your last call, but I'm very happy for you and your family.
Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Dawn.
Dawn Gilbertson -- USA Today -- Consumer Travel Reporter
I have a couple of questions, first, for Vasu, following up on Mary's question about kind of the lag in bookings because of omicron, spring break and summer. I'm wondering whether you guys are considering extending your -- the expiration date for tickets and for current travel credits? And my second question is probably for Robert, but maybe not. Your call times, like a lot of airlines still are pretty high, as recently as Friday, it was four hours plus. Can you give any specifics on what you're doing to address this persistent problem and what's behind it?
Robert Isom -- President
It's great to hear from you, Dawn. I'll start and then others can add in, too. So first of all, we are assessing different options for what we call stored value, what we do with people who have COVID-related credits that are out there. We've been really encouraged by what we've seen.
We're the only airline that allows customers to do name changes and reassign them in. Because of that, we've seen a lot of consumers go and take advantage of that flexibility. And so that, combined with the fact that we've flown with bigger airline, has led us to, at least, believe that we may be seeing is probably a little bit different than others. But we're assessing what our options are, and we'll have more in the not distant future.
Vasu Raja -- Chief Revenue Officer
Dawn, and Maya may want to help me out with this. But hey, with reservations right now, with so many changes that are going on in the environment, whether it's travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, schedule changes. You name it. The level of calls that we're getting right now is really unprecedented, and for good reasons.
And what we're trying to do with -- to make sure is that not only do we have all of the resources from a reservations perspective available. But we're also investing in things like chat and then callback functions as well. And one of the things I'm really proud of is while we have had some extended callback times as of late, I'm really proud of the way we've performed throughout the pandemic. American has consistently performed better than a lot of our competitors.
And as we come out of this huge call volume spike, and I expect us to get back to really reasonable and satisfactory times. Maya, do you want to add anything else?
Maya Leibman -- Executive Vice President and Chief Information Officer
Yes. Just following up on some of the technologies that we've implemented in res around a virtual assistant, which is sort of artificial intelligence that can respond to some of the easier questions without the customer having to interact with an agent. And they can -- that's a win-win because the customer can really do that asynchronously and get their answer in short order, that, then this is on to chat for more difficult questions. Our res agents are now trained.
We have hundreds now trained to be able to handle a chat. And again, this allows them to handle more than one interaction at a time, which is better for our customers and more productive for our agents. And then but like Robert said, that really helps defray some of the impact to reservations. But at the end of the day, the nature of the questions that we're getting are so complex, where people are really wanting to fully understand what are the COVID restrictions in traveling here? What kind of vaccination status do I have to have? How do I use this store value combined with this form of payment? And in those cases, we still need our fabulous res agents to be able to handle those.
Dawn Gilbertson -- USA Today -- Consumer Travel Reporter

Doug Parker -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Dawn, before you sign off, with everyone listening in, you would have absolutely been in my prepared remarks whereas it's the peers still on the line.

1129.0,2020-08-10 00:00:00 UTC,"Why Alcoa Stock Rose Today, But Shopify and Zoom Video Shares Dropped",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-alcoa-stock-rose-today-but-shopify-and-zoom-video-shares-dropped-2020-08-10,,,"What happened
The Dow Jones index of blue chip industrial stocks climbed 1.3% on Monday while the tech heavy Nasdaq slumped 0.4%. Illustrative of what is happening:
Shares of tech stars Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) and Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM) dropped 4.5% and 3.4%, respectively, but industrial stalwart Alcoa (NYSE: AA) climbed to close 6.1% higher.
Image source: Getty Images.
So what
According to MarketWatch, there's a rotation underway, as investors sell off high-growth companies deemed to be tech stocks, which have run up significantly since the market plumbed its lows in March, and instead shift their money into cyclical companies like Alcoa, which haven't yet managed to return to their highs before the COVID-19 sell-off.  
But that's more of an observation than an explanation, telling you what is happening but not why.
Now what
The reason Alcoa is moving higher, I suspect, has little to do with investors deciding that all of a sudden, the U.S. economy is going to shift into high gear, causing cyclical industrial stocks to outperform go-go tech stocks. With 30 million workers still unemployed, and 5 million Americans having contracted COVID-19, I honestly don't see an industrial boom in the making here.  
Rather, I suspect Alcoa's stock-price surge has everything to do with President Trump's threat, made late last week, to reimpose 10% tariffs on certain Canadian aluminum imports. While not everyone in the metals industry is on board with the plan, the simple fact is that, when tariffs make imported aluminum more expensive, they give domestic producers more leeway to raise their own prices without risk of being underpriced by foreign competition.
So much for Alcoa. More tariffs equals more profit: Thar's pretty clear. But what about Shopify and Zoom, the tech stocks that are getting sold off?
Here, MarketWatch's rotation theory may actually have more merit. There doesn't seem to be any actual news dragging these stocks down today. But over the weekend, Barron's magazine called out Shopify and Zoom as two particular examples of special exuberance among tech investors (irrational or otherwise), highlighting their extremely rich valuations of 50 times forward sales (Shopify) and 40 times forward sales (Zoom).
When you consider that Shopify still isn't profitable, while Zoom is only barely so (earning just $0.17 per each $250-priced share last quarter), those valuations look pretty scary.  
Maybe even scary enough to frighten a few investors into selling today.

3574.0,2022-04-27 00:00:00 UTC,COLUMN-Global miners rank ESG as their top concern. Really?: Russell,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/column-global-miners-rank-esg-as-their-top-concern.-really%3A-russell,,,"By Clyde Russell
LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 27 (Reuters) - Environment, social and governance (ESG) issues are the top concern of global miners, knocking out commodity price risk for the first time, according to a new survey.
KPMG said it was a ""significant milestone"" as ESG for the first time topped the list of industry risks in its 12-year-old Global Mining Outlook.
While commodity price risk dropped to second place, another issue closely related to ESG, namely community relations and social licence to operate, came in third spot.
Rounding out the top five risks were political instability and nationalisation at number four, and global trade conflict at number five.
The top five risks for global miners neatly encapsulate the short-term issues as well as the overarching long-term factor of addressing climate change and decarbonisation.
The question that executives should be answering is how they are preparing their companies to deal with the longer-term risks.
KPMG points out that addressing the challenges brings opportunities to ""invest in innovative ways and adapt at a faster pace.""
The survey, released on Tuesday, shows that 72% of mining executives agree or strongly agree that ""ESG will be a cause of major disruption in the industry over the coming three years.""
If mining executives really believe this, it seems somewhat strange that they have to yet to re-organise and re-orientate their management structures and efforts to reflect that view.
Not one of the biggest listed Western mining companies has an executive with a title of chief ESG officer, and only one has a person with a somewhat similar title.
While some of the companies do have executives tasked with ESG, they also tend to have several other responsibilities, which raises the question of how much of their time and effort goes into ESG.
LOW-PROFILE LEADERS
For example, BHP Group BHP.AX, the world's biggest mining company, has Caroline Cox listed on its website as chief legal, governance and external affairs officer, a position she assumed in November 2020.
It's interesting that her legal role takes precedence in the title, and it's also worth noting that Cox has what at best could be described as a very low profile on social media.
An internet search of her name reveals only a small number of articles, mostly about her appointment and certainly very little on her role in preparing BHP to meet the challenge of ESG.
At Rio Tinto RIO.AX, it's much the same story, with the company website not listing an executive with specific ESG responsibilities, the closest being Isabelle Deschamps, who is chief legal officer and external affairs.
Appointed in November 2021 after Rio's reputation took a severe blow when it destroyed ancient Aboriginal caves in Western Australia state, Deschamps also has a low social media and internet profile.
Glencore GLEN.L doesn't list any executive responsible for ESG on its management team, while Brazil's Vale VALE3.SA appears to split the responsibility between two of its executives, although it does list Maria Luiza de Oliveira Pinto e Paiva as executive vice president of sustainability.
Among the top miners, perhaps the executive with the highest profile is Anglo American's AAL.L Anik Michaud, the group director of corporate relations and sustainable impact.
But while she has more of an active presence on such social media sites as Twitter and LinkedIn, she doesn't appear to be a leading contributor to the ESG debate.
Rather, ESG issues in the major miners are largely left to the various chief executives, as when several committed their companies to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
But these undertakings are often criticised as vague and lacking a clear path of firm commitments over specified time periods.
Overall, while the internal workings of individual mining companies will differ, it doesn't appear that the majors have aligned their management structures and efforts with what they have told KPMG is their top concern.
It's not that mining companies don't have good stories to tell. After all, they will be responsible for producing the raw materials, such as copper, nickel and lithium, needed for the global energy transition.
But perhaps they should be leading the discussion on how to boost production while at the same time decarbonising their operations.

3298.0,2022-08-22 00:00:00 UTC,Should You Invest in the U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS)?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-you-invest-in-the-u.s.-global-jets-etf-jets-3,,,"The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) was launched on 04/30/2015, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Industrials - Transportation/Shipping segment of the equity market.
Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.
Sector ETFs also provide investors access to a broad group of companies in particular sectors that offer low risk and diversified exposure. Industrials - Transportation/Shipping is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification. It is currently ranked 1, placing it in top 6%.
Index Details
The fund is sponsored by U.S. Global Investors. It has amassed assets over $2.62 billion, making it one of the largest ETFs attempting to match the performance of the Industrials - Transportation/Shipping segment of the equity market. JETS seeks to match the performance of the U.S. Global Jets Index before fees and expenses.
The U.S. Global Jets Index tracks the performance of Airline Companies across the globe with an emphasis on domestic passenger airlines.
Costs
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.60%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.78%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
Looking at individual holdings, United Airls Hldgs Inc (UAL) accounts for about 12.29% of total assets, followed by Delta Air Lines Inc Del (DAL) and American Airls Group Inc (AAL).
The top 10 holdings account for about 61.17% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
Year-to-date, the U.S. Global Jets ETF has lost about -16.86% so far, and is down about -15.43% over the last 12 months (as of 08/22/2022). JETS has traded between $16.05 and $24.89 in this past 52-week period.
The ETF has a beta of 1.32 and standard deviation of 47.35% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high risk choice in the space. With about 57 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
U.S. Global Jets ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, JETS is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Industrials ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.
SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN) tracks S&P Transportation Select Industry Index and the iShares U.S. Transportation ETF (IYT) tracks Dow Jones Transportation Average Index. SPDR S&P Transportation ETF has $519.92 million in assets, iShares U.S. Transportation ETF has $923.17 million. XTN has an expense ratio of 0.35% and IYT charges 0.41%.

1400.0,2013-04-10 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa Technology Licensed to Chemetall - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-technology-licensed-to-chemetall-analyst-blog-2013-04-10,,,"Aluminum giant Alcoa inc. ( AA ) is licensing its pre-treatment bonding technology to Chemetall, a division of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. ( ROC ), in an exclusive global distribution pact. The Alcoa 951 is a breakthrough technology and is the new pre-treatment bonding standard for aluminum sheet, extrusion and casting suppliers across the automotive industry.
Alcoa 951 is a patented, chrome-free pre-treatment that enables production of more durable bonds between an aluminum substrate and a structural adhesive used in an assembly process. Alcoa reported that Alcoa 951 has been proven to be up to nine times more durable than titanium zirconium applications that were more widely used in the automotive industry in the past.
Alcoa 951 technology is significantly beneficial for Alcoa's customers and is a perfect example of Alcoa Technology Advantage. The technology makes possible wide usage of aluminum throughout the automotive industry and help in making mass-produced aluminum-intensive vehicles possible, thus saving fuel.
As per automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the use of aluminum in cars is expected to double by 2025 as automakers seek more fuel efficiency by reducing vehicle mass. Currently, aluminum represents the second largest-volume component material in automotive vehicles. Many OEMs are expanding aluminum use from heat exchangers, wheels, drive shafts, engine blocks, hoods and deck lids to develop aluminum intensive vehicles (AIVs) by converting the body in white, or body structure, to aluminum.
By collaborating with Chemetall, Alcoa will be able to commercialize adhesive bonding of aluminum structures in high-volume automotive applications.
Alcoa is the world leader with respect to production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina as well as the world's largest miner of bauxite and refiner of alumina.
Alcoa released its first quarter 2013 financial results on Apr 8. The company saw its profit surge roughly 59% in first-quarter 2013, buoyed by strong aluminum demand. It posted a profit of $149 million or 13 cents per share in the quarter, exceeding the profit of $94 million or 9 cents per share recorded a year ago. The results were driven by strong demand across the aerospace and auto markets.
Excluding one-time special items, Alcoa earned $121 million or 11 cents a share in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and also coming ahead of $105 million or 10 cents per share posted in the year-ago quarter.
Revenues declined roughly 3% to $5,833 million from $6,006 million in the year-ago quarter and were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,857 million. Sales were hurt by lower aluminum prices and reduced production in Alcoa's European primary metals business.
Alcoa currently retains a short-term Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Other companies in the mining industry with favorable Zacks Rank are Atlatsa Resources Corporation ( ATL ) and Anglo American Platinum Ltd. ( AGPPY ). Both hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3337.0,2022-08-05 00:00:00 UTC,U.S. hotels spin travel demand into gold as airlines struggle,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-hotels-spin-travel-demand-into-gold-as-airlines-struggle,,,"By Gigi Zamora
Aug 5 (Reuters) - Staff shortages, airport chaos and higher fuel costs have caused earnings at U.S. airlines like JetBlue Airways to land below analysts' expectations while hotel chains including Marriott International are reporting double-digit profit growth.
Despite cutbacks in other categories due to recession worries, consumers eager to travel after the pandemic continue to book flights and hotels. Hotels have been able to turn this demand into increased profitability far more effectively than airlines.
David Tarsh, spokesperson for travel data analytics company Forward Keys, said the problems faced by airlines and airports are harder to resolve than those in the lodging industry.
""In the case of labor in hospitality, your shortage is probably more with less-skilled workers than in the case of the aviation industry,"" he said. ""If you're short of cabin crew and you're short of security people in the airport, you can't just increase wages and suddenly fill these roles. People also need to be trained.""
U.S. carriers are struggling to offset higher costs such as fuel even as booming travel demand has given them strong pricing power.
JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O on Tuesday reported a quarterly adjusted loss of 47 cents per share compared to analysts’ predictions of an 11-cent loss.
United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O, American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O and Delta Air Lines Inc DAL last month reported quarterly profits below analysts' expectations.
Meanwhile, hotel bookings are surging. Marriott International Inc MAR.O on Tuesday topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profits, helped by higher occupancy levels and room rates as travelers booked more group travel and longer stays.
Last month, Hilton Worldwide Holdings HLT.N saw profit rise above pre-pandemic levels. On Wednesday, MGM Resorts International MGM.N reported profit 25% higher than in the second quarter of 2019 and said staff shortage problems seemed to be easing.
“Generally speaking, we're in decent shape. We are not running around with our hair on fire, if you will, anymore,” said MGM Resorts CEO Bill Hornbuckle in Wednesday'searnings call
Host Hotels & Resorts Inc HST.O, which operates hotels under the Four Seasons, Grand Hyatt and Ritz Carlton brands, reported profits of 36 cents per share, higher than analysts' predictions.
""We're up into the double digits in terms of total revenue (growth) for Thanksgiving. And actually, for Christmas, we are seeing a solid pickup as well,” said Host CEO Jim Risoleo on a call for analysts on Thursday.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

The trend for the week continues, which is a choppy difficult environment thanks to the monthly options expiration. Now, let’s look at a few top stock trades for next week.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: S&P 500 ETF (SPY)

The S&P 500 didn’t give bulls the most encouraging candle to work with on Friday. What’s known as a bearish engulfing candle, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) opened above Thursday’s high but closed below it.
It’s also trading below the 10-day moving average.
From here, it looks like last week’s low could be in play, along with a test of the 21-day moving average and the topside of prior downtrend resistance.

That area should be good for a bounce. If it’s not, a further decline down to the $422 to $425 area is possible. There, the SPY finds the 10-week moving average, the 50-day moving average and its daily VWAP measure.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Gold ETF (GLD)

Gold has also been getting some attention with all this inflation talk, putting the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD) on investors’ radar.
There’s a few things going on with this name. First, shares filled the gap near $171. However, it tagged the 200-day moving average and is now stalling near this zone. That said, it’s finding support on the current dip down at the 10-week and 10-day moving averages.
So, now what?
Watch Friday’s low. A break and close below the low puts a new support area in play, that being the $167.50 zone. Is that too close to current support? Maybe. But there the GLD should find a trifecta of support from the 21-day, 21-week and daily VWAP measure.
On the upside, we really need to see this name clear the 200-day moving average, then the 50-day. Above that puts $175 in play, with the gap-fill near $175.50.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Coinbase (COIN)

Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) was showing promise at the start of the week. However, shares then broke down.
We’ve since seen the stock lose most of its major moving averages, as well as its daily VWAP measure. Coinbase hasn’t been trading well, but perhaps it’s trying to bottom.
We have an inside day on Friday while the overall market is lower. If Coinbase breaks the two-day low and can’t reclaim it, it puts the $208 to $213 area in play.

On the upside, though, it has to reclaim all of those major moving averages that it lost before it can gain any meaningful momentum.
Top Trades for Monday No. 4: American Airlines (AAL)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) moved lower on the day and tested down into last week’s low.
If shares break the two-week low and can’t reclaim it, this one may be heading down to its 200-day moving average and that key $18.50 area. From there, I would expect some sort of support.
If it holds, look for a rebound back up toward $20-plus. The other level to watch here? The 10-week moving average. For now, that level is holding as support. We’ll see how long that lasts.

In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.77% for Agilent Technologies, Inc., 2.15% for Cardinal Health, Inc., and 0.91% for Encompass Health Corp.

With the stock market becoming more volatile in recent years, investors are increasingly looking for new opportunities to invest their money. One such opportunity is investing in overlooked industries that have the potential to generate high returns.
These overlooked industries often have solid fundamentals and a forward-looking approach that can help investors maximize their returns.
Investing in these overlooked industries can greatly diversify your portfolio and create a long-term investment strategy. By researching these industries and understanding their potential, investors can make informed decisions about where to invest their money.
With the right research and analysis, investors can find undervalued companies in overlooked industries with strong fundamentals that could provide them with substantial returns in the future.
Airlines

Investing in airline stocks is a great way to diversify your portfolio, with several top-tier companies worth considering.
These include well-known names as well as lesser-known but still promising companies. Investing in these stocks can be a great way to take advantage of the lucrative aviation industry.
The effects of the pandemic on the aviation industry have been felt worldwide, with airlines facing unprecedented challenges in revenue, operations, and customer service.
However, things are now perking up for the airline sector. People are traveling again in mass numbers; TSA numbers will vouch for this. This is great news for the airline sector.
The surge in demand is being felt throughout the sector, so it is a great time to invest in airlines. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is one of the sector’s stars.
On the back of high demand during the holiday season, American Airlines reported fourth-quarter profit that topped estimates. The legacy carrier saw revenue increase by nearly 17% compared to 2019, before the Covid pandemic drastically reduced travel.
American Airlines showed robust performance despite running at 6.1% lower capacity, evidencing that passengers are willing to pay higher fares for their tickets.
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is another strong performer in the airline sector. One of the world’s oldest airlines in operation, it reported impressive financial results despite mass weather-related cancellations during the holiday
season.
In addition, Delta is investing in more fuel-efficient jets, ultimately improving its financial performance and resulting in long-term benefits. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2025.
Basic Materials Sector

For investors looking to make a contrarian play in the stock market, now is the time to invest in the basic materials sector.
With global economic uncertainty and macroeconomic trends pointing towards a recovery, now is an opportune time for investors to take advantage of the current market conditions and invest in this sector.
The basic materials sector comprises companies that produce raw materials such as metals, minerals, chemicals, and energy. The pandemic hit this sector hard, but it is now showing signs of recovery.
As governments worldwide begin to relax restrictions, demand for these raw materials is expected to increase significantly. This presents a great opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on this trend and make long-term investments in this sector.
The star performer within the industry is the oil and gas sector. It has seen the most growth for two consecutive years due to the impact of both global economic recovery post-pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war in oil markets.
Oil companies have prioritized dividends and stock repurchases to appeal to shareholders worried about overproduction. This effective move has served to maintain price momentum. Investors have benefited financially as a result of these decisions.
There is a risk of a global recession which could lead to reduced energy demand. There’s also the danger of oil prices staying too high for a long, resulting in decreased demand.
Despite this, the oil and gas industry offers plenty of attractive stocks for investors to diversify their portfolios. For example, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), and Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) are among the best companies you will find in this sector. All are companies with a strong dividend history and robust operating models.
Credit Bureaus
Source: wutzkohphoto / Shutterstock
Investing in credit-scoring companies is a safe but often overlooked investment opportunity.
Credit scoring companies are responsible for assessing the creditworthiness of individuals and businesses, enabling lenders to make informed decisions about lending and borrowing.
Despite this important role in the economy, they have been largely overlooked by investors when it comes to stock market investments.
Investing in credit-scoring companies can provide investors with a reliable source of income and exposure to an industry that is not often given enough attention.
Credit score has become an integral part of the financial services sector. It is widely used by lenders, investors, and consumers, giving it credibility. Lenders trust the credit scoring system to make important decisions, whereas consumers use it to understand their financial standing.
The powerful network effects of this industry give it a monopolistic edge. In the U.S., there are three major credit bureaus – Equifax (NYSE:EFX), Experian (OTCMKTS:EXPGF), and TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) – responsible for providing credit reports.
Investing in credit bureaus is not only profitable but also relatively low-risk. Since these companies have been around for decades, they are well-established and have a proven track record of success.

For the SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactors ETF (Symbol: QUS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $131.46 per unit.
With QUS trading at a recent price near $116.66 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.69% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QUS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are CVS Health Corporation (Symbol: CVS), Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA), and Bank of America Corp (Symbol: BAC). Although CVS has traded at a recent price of $68.58/share, the average analyst target is 51.80% higher at $104.11/share. Similarly, AA has 40.10% upside from the recent share price of $35.37 if the average analyst target price of $49.55/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BAC to reach a target price of $36.58/share, which is 35.02% above the recent price of $27.09.

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

3518.0,2022-05-31 00:00:00 UTC,Is United Airlines Stock On The Move?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-united-airlines-stock-on-the-move,,,"The shares of United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) have remained relatively flat since April despite a sizable contraction in broader markets. Rising energy costs and skyrocketing inflation have taken a toll on growth and profitability metrics of the transportation industry, but strong air travel demand is likely to drive UAL stock as macroeconomic tensions ease. While the geopolitical uncertainty due to the Russia-Ukraine war is jeopardizing global economic growth and triggering measures such as new energy security alliances, passenger numbers at TSA checkpoints is a positive indicator for the airline industry. Moreover, United Airlines incurred $4 billion of operating cash burn in the last two years which stands lower than the $10 billion contraction in its market capitalization. Our interactive dashboard on United Airlines valuation highlights the historical trends in revenues, earnings, valuation multiple, and forecast for FY2022.
How did United Airlines perform in 2021 and Q1 2022?
In 2021, United Airlines reported $24.6 billion of total revenues and $2 billion of operating cash assisted by PSP-2 and PSP-3 (payroll support program) proceeds. The company’s operating metrics reached pre-pandemic levels during the latter part of the year as declining infection rates pushed travel demand. In H1 2021, the company’s ASMs (available seat miles), occupancy rate, and yield (cents) were 70k, 65.4%, and 14.60, respectively. For the full-year, ASMs (available seat miles), occupancy rate, and yield (cents) reached 178k, 72.2%, and 15.66, respectively. While the demand factors improved during fall and winter, inflationary pressures from the Russia-Ukraine war and supply chain hurdles created macroeconomic headwinds for the airline industry.
In Q1 2022, the company reported $7.5 billion in revenues – just 21% lower than Q1 2019. Rising benchmark prices, staffing issues, and the Omicron wave augmented operational challenges. Notably, CASM-Ex (cost per available seat miles excluding fuel expense) surged by 18% when compared to Q1 2019, largely due to comparable overall costs and lower aircraft utilization rate. Thus, United booked a net loss of $1.4 billion for the quarter.
Inflation moving in sync with benchmark oil prices
The consumer price index for urban consumers (CPI-U) observed an 8.3% (y-o-y) jump in April 2022, primarily from rising energy costs which are having ripple effects across the economy. Inflation in key items such as food, energy, other commodities, shelter, medical services, and airline fares was 9.4%, 30.3%, 9.7%, 5.1%, 3.5%, and 33.3%, respectively. Given the 40% increase in benchmark oil prices in the past year, increasing airfares is the only option for airlines to bolster their bottom line. Interestingly, the Brent benchmark is likely to trend downward from $103 in 2022 to $97 in 2023 according to EIA. Similarly, the World Bank expects Brent crude to observe a decline from $100 in 2022 to $92 in 2023 and $80 in 2024 – raising hopes of a return to normalcy as geopolitical tensions ease in various parts of the world.

3586.0,2022-04-22 00:00:00 UTC,"Rate Hike Talks, Surging Bond Yields Overwhelm Wall Street",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/rate-hike-talks-surging-bond-yields-overwhelm-wall-street,,,"The earnings season is bringing Wall Street no reprieve from the volatility that has plagued it over the last few months. That was made clear at the beginning of the week, with stocks ultimately finishing lower on Monday, after the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield surged to a three-year high, while natural gas prices jumped to their highest level since 2008. Upbeat earnings from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) add nearly 500 points on Tuesday, and the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) and S&P 500 Index (SPX) logged their best day in over one month as tech stocks rallied. The Dow's rally extended into Wednesday as more blue-chip names stepped into the earnings confessional, though the Nasdaq and S&P 500 had already started to cool.
The market took a sharp turn for the worse on Thursday, with rising bond yields adding pressure after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested bigger rate hikes might be coming next month to counteract high inflation, with a 50 basis point hike now on the table. In turn, bond yields resumed their climb toward 2018 highs. Stocks were last seen eyeing losses on Friday, with the Dow pacing for its fourth-straight weekly drop, while the SPX and IXIC were on track a third consecutive week in the red. 
Busy Week of Earnings
The earnings season is in full-swing, with multiple high-profile names stepping into the spotlight. Among them was Tesla (TSLA), which posted a top- and bottom-line beat, and predicted 60% delivery growth for 2022. Pharmaceutical name JNJ drew attention, too, hitting a post-earnings record high, despite suspending sales guidance of its Covid-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, analysts and options traders alike were eyeing J.B. Hunt's (JBHT) upbeat results, and Procter & Gamble (PG) edged higher on a strong sales forecast for the year.
The talk of the town was Netflix (NFLX), though, which tumbled after posting a surprise subscriber loss. Airlines were in focus as well, with American Airlines (AAL) soaring on high travel demand, while calls popped on struggling United Airlines (UAL) ahead of its report. Another notable name on the earnings docket was AT&T (T), which landed a red-hot options pit after announcing a core wireless revenue jump. The last few names to enter the confessional were Snap (SNAP), which dipped after missing estimates on both the top- and bottom-line, and Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), which popped on better-than-expected results.
  Top Analyst Calls
Analysts made several calls, too, as they worked their way through the earnings deluge. Wendy's (WEN) kicked off the week with a downgrade to ""market perform,"" with BMO predicting high inflation to hit the fast-food giant harder than some of its peer. Sirius XM (SIRI) was under fire as well, drawing out a downgrade to ""underweight"" from Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, social media giant Snap (SNAP) scored fresh coverage ahead of its earnings report.
Elsewhere, Progressive (PGR) tumbled after Piper Sandler hit it with a downgrade and price-target cut, with the analyst in coverage noting excessive optimism around auto insurance rates. Plus, the brokerage's review of the renewable energy sector saw it slashing its price target on Enphase Energy (ENPH). In other news, options bears responded to JetBlue's (JBLU) downgrade, and Dow's (DOW) upbeat earnings attracted a flurry of bull notes.
Big Tech Earnings in Focus Next Week
The earnings deluge continues next week with multiple Big Tech reports, which will be accompanied by a slew of indicators to keep investors busy during the last week of April. Reports will be coming from the likes of 3M (MMM), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Chevron (CVX), Coca-Cola (KO), Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Pinterest (PINS) Spotify(SPOT), and Twitter (TWTR), as well as many others. In addition, durable goods orders, pending home sales, and the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) are on the calendar. You can prepare for what lies ahead by understanding what high oil prices could mean for the SPX, and keeping tabs on these ""make or break"" levels for the index.

1180.0,2014-03-28 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa Gains on Launch of Lightweight Wheel - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-gains-on-launch-of-lightweight-wheel-analyst-blog-2014-03-28,,,"Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) shares gained 6% as the aluminum giant launched its latest innovation - the world's lightest heavy-duty truck wheel, the Ultra ONE. Ultra ONE is a new 40-pound wheel and being 47% lighter than steel wheels of the same size will help trucks carry more load and also improve fuel efficiency. Alcoa Wheel and Transportation Products, a business unit of Alcoa, has come up with this new innovation.
The Ultra ONE can save about 1,400 pounds per rig which will help the fleets to carry more goods while meeting the severe federal emissions regulations. Fleets have been increasingly converted to aluminum wheels, thereby reducing the need of pollution-control equipment that is used to meet federal emissions regulations. The lightweight wheels help improve fuel economy which is a positive in the times of rising fuel prices. The transition to aluminum wheels from steel wheels helps in reducing annual carbon footprint emission.
Alcoa's wheels are six times brighter than competitors' wheels due to their corrosion resistant quality, which helps in lowering operators' maintenance and operating costs. As most of the companies are now switching to lightweight fleets, America's largest flatbed carrier, TMC Transportation, will also follow the same path in 2014.
The Ultra ONE wheel will utilize the MagnaForce alloy which is invented by the world's largest light metals research center, the Alcoa Technical Center. The alloy is 17% stronger than the industry standard- Alcoa's 6061 alloy.
Alcoa, which is among the prominent players in the mining industry along with Aluminum Corporation of China Limited ( ACH ), BHP Billiton Limited ( BHP ), Rio and Tinto Plc. ( RIO ), is a world leader with respect to production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina as well as the world's largest miner of bauxite and refiner of alumina.

4520.0,2021-04-22 00:00:00 UTC,Top Cyclical Stocks Worth Investing In? 4 To Consider,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-cyclical-stocks-worth-investing-in-4-to-consider-2021-04-22,,,"Could These Be The Top Cyclical Stocks In The Stock Market Today?
Cyclical stocks are likely among the most trending stocks in the stock market today. Why? Well, for starters, cyclical stocks tend to follow the flow of the economy. Accordingly, there has been a slew of positive figures pointing towards broader economic recovery lately. Just this morning, the U.S. Labor Department revealed that there were 547,000 first-time unemployment insurance claims last week. Notably, this marks another pandemic-era low following last week’s 576,000 claims, below the Dow Jones estimate of 603,000. On this news, it would not surprise me to see investors looking out for the top cyclical stocks now.
After all, seasoned investors such as National Securities’ chief market strategist, Art Hogan, appear bullish on cyclical stocks now. Hogan said in a recent CNBC interview that it is important to have “a balance” of growth stocks and cyclical stocks now. In turn, he also argues that rebalancing between the two every couple of months puts investors “in a position to beat the S&P handily”. Evidently, both Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) and Carnival Corporation (NYSE: CCL) continue to outpace the S&P 500 threefold year-to-date. As pandemic conditions continue to improve, I could see this trend continue. Having read till this point, you might be interested to invest in some of the top cyclical stocks on the stock market now. Should that be the case, here are four in focus now.
Cyclical Stocks To Buy [Or Sell] Right Now
American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL)
AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T)
Pool Corporation (NASDAQ: POOL)
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE: NCLH)
American Airlines Group Inc.
American Airlines (AAL) is one of the largest airlines in the world. Pre-pandemic, it offered nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries. The company also has a cargo division that provides a range of freight and mail services with facilities and interline connections available across the globe. AAL stock currently trades at $20.45 as of 1:59 p.m. ET and is up by over 35% year-to-date. Today, the company reported its first-quarter financial results and continues to see a recovery in demand for air travel.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
In detail, revenue for the quarter was $4 billion. Despite the airline industry being badly hit last year, the company could be on the verge of a comeback. It has managed to raise $10 billion through debt offering and this could help the company weather through what hopefully could be the last leg of the pandemic. AAL also ended the quarter with approximately $17.3 billion in total available liquidity.
AAL’s Chairman and CEO Doug Parker had this to say, “Looking forward, with the momentum underway from the first quarter, we see signs of continued recovery in demand. We remain confident the network enhancements, customer-focused improvements, and efficiency measures we’ve put into place will ensure American is well-positioned for the recovery.” Given all of this, should you consider buying AAL stock ahead of the economy fully reopening?

Diving into its financials, the company reported record net sales of over $1 billion for the quarter, a 56% increase year-over-year.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings
Last but not least, we have Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH). In short, the company is among the largest cruise line operators globally, in terms of passengers. By NCLH’s estimates, the company boasts a combined fleet of 28 ships, offering voyages to over 490 destinations worldwide.
Source: TD Ameritrade TOS
If that wasn’t enough, NCLH is also among the key cruise line players in active discussions with the CDC to restart cruise operations. With the company’s portfolio and influence in the industry, investors may be watching NCLH stock closely now. Likewise, the company’s shares are currently looking at gains of over 170% in the past year. Could it be worth investing in right now?
Well, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) analyst Stephen Grambling appears to believe so. Earlier this week, Grambling hit NCLH stock with a buy rating, raising his price target from $27 to $37 a share.

2924.0,2023-02-01 00:00:00 UTC,U.S. airline group blasts White House competition efforts,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-airline-group-blasts-white-house-competition-efforts-0,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A group representing major U.S. airlines on Wednesday blasted White House proposals on competition in the industry as ""short-sighted"" and said they would ""drive-up costs and reduce choices"" for consumers.
The White House said on Wednesday the Transportation Department (USDOT) will propose new regulations to bar airlines from charging family members to sit near young children after DOT in 2021 proposed requiring airlines to refund fees for delayed bags.
""The federal government should be focused on 21st century policies and procedures that drive our nation’s aviation system forward, rather than making efforts that threaten to reduce access and affordability for consumers,"" said Airlines for America (A4A), a group representing Delta Air Lines DAL.N, United Airlines UAL.O, American Airlines AAL.O, Southwest Airlines LUV.N and others.
A4A said its member airlines ""make every effort to accommodate customers traveling together, especially those traveling with children, without additional charges.""
The Biden administration has taken steps it says will inject more competition into the airline industry. The U.S. Justice Department sued to unwind American Airlines Northeast Alliance with JetBlue Airways JBLU.O and USDOT reassigned 16 peak-hour flights at congested Newark Airport to Spirit Airlines SAVE.N.
A4A on Wednesday said ""the White House should get the facts straight amid efforts to impose new policies and regulations on our nation’s aviation industry."" The White House declined to comment.
A4A separately posted a point-by-point statement Wednesday seeking to refute comments Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg made on CNBC about airline competition, arguing ""there is no evidence of a market failure or unfair or deceptive practices."" USDOT did not comment.
Airlines are facing growing calls in Congress to boost consumer protections after a series of disruptions including a holiday meltdown at Southwest that resulted in the cancellation of more than 16,000 flights.
Airlines have previously sparred with Buttigieg over flight disruptions this summer. Buttigieg pushed airlines to adopt consumer protections even as some critics say he has not been tough enough on airlines.
U.S. lawmakers Tuesday proposed sweeping legislation to require airline passengers get refunds for delayed flights, prohibit airlines from further shrinking plane seat sizes and give consumers new rights to sue airlines for unfair practices.
A4A said ""instituting government-controlled pricing, establishing a private right of action and dictating private sector contracts – would decrease competition and inevitably lead to higher ticket prices and reduced services to small and rural communities.""

857.0,2022-03-11 00:00:00 UTC,"Is Alcoa (AA) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think "" Yes """,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-alcoa-aa-a-solid-growth-stock-3-reasons-to-think-yes,,,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.
By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.
However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.
Our proprietary system currently recommends Alcoa (AA) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.
While the historical EPS growth rate for Alcoa is 6.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 36.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 24%.
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.
Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alcoa is 347.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 63.5%.
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 31.9% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 27.6%.
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.
The current-year earnings estimates for Alcoa have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 33.2% over the past month.
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alcoa a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
This combination indicates that Alcoa is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

Stocks this morning are mixed, with the Nasdaq 100 falling to a 7-week low.  U.S. stocks have some carryover support from a recovery in Chinese stocks.  Also, the broader market is moving higher on signs that the U.S. economy can achieve a soft landing after weekly jobless claims fell more than expected and after the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey rose to a 16-month high.  However, rising bond yields are weighing on technology stocks and are dragging the Nasdaq 100 lower after the 10-year T-note yield today rose to a 9-3/4 month high.
U.S. stock indexes have some positive carryover from a slight recovery in Chinese stocks after the Shanghai Stock Index rebounded from a 7-1/2 month low when the Zhongzhi Enterprise Group said it plans to restructure debt and sell assets after the review in order to repay investors.  This week, Chinese stocks have been under pressure as liquidity concerns in China’s shadow banking system intensified after Zhongrong International Trust, a unit of Zhongzhi Enterprise Group, missed payments on dozens of its investment products. 
U.S. weekly initial unemployment claims fell -9,000 to 239,000, showing a slightly stronger labor market than expectations of 240,000.

The markets are discounting the odds at 12% for a +25 bp rate hike at the September 20 FOMC meeting and 43% for that +25 bp rate hike at the November 1 FOMC meeting.

Today’s stock movers…
Cisco Systems (CSCO) is up more than +4% to lead gainers in the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials, and Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q4 revenue of $15.20 billion, better than the consensus of $15.05 billion, and forecasting Q1 revenue of $14.50 billion-$14.70 billion, the midpoint above the consensus of $14.57 billion. 
Ball Corp (BALL) is up more than +3% after BAE Systems agreed to buy Ball’s aerospace division for around $5.6 billion.

Health insurance stocks are falling today after Blue Shield of California said it plans to drop CVS Health’s Caremark as its primary pharmacy benefit manager.  As a result, CVS Health (CVS) is down more than -9% to lead losers in the S&P 500.  Also, Cigna Group (CI) is down more than -6% and Cardinal Health (CAH) is down more than -3%.  In addition, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), McKesson (MCK), Centene (CNC),and Molina Healthcare (MOH) are down more than -2%.

Across the markets…
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU23) today are down -7 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is up +5.3 bp at 4.304%.  Sep T-notes today dropped to a 10-month nearest-futures low, and the 10-year T-note yield climbed to a 9-3/4 month high of 4.310%. T-notes have negative carryover from a plunge in 10-year UK gilts today to a 14-year low.  Also, today’s stronger-than-expected U.S. economic news on weekly jobless claims and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey were hawkish for Fed policy and bearish for T-notes. 
The dollar index (DXY00) today is down by -0.27%.  The dollar today retreated from a 2-month high and is moderately lower. Strength in stocks today has reduced the liquidity demand for the dollar.  Also, a recovery in the yuan today weighed on the dollar after the yuan rebounded from a 9-1/2 month low against the dollar and moved higher on a report that said Chinese authorities told state-owned banks to step up intervention in the currency market this week to support the yuan and that government officials are considering the use of tools such as cutting banks’ foreign-exchange reserve requirements to prevent a rapid depreciation in the yuan. 
EUR/USD (^EURUSD) today is up by +0.21%.  The euro today recovered from a 6-week low and is moderately higher as weakness in the dollar sparked short covering in EUR/USD.  The euro today initially moved lower on dovish comments from ECB Governing Council member Kazaks who said he was undecided on an ECB rate hike in September.
ECB Governing Council member Kazaks said he was undecided on an ECB rate hike in September and said, ""If we look at the coming months, if there'll be increases in interest rates, then they'll be really very small.""
USD/JPY (^USDJPY) is down by -0.29%.  The yen today recovered from a 9-1/4 month low against the dollar and moved higher after the 10-year JGB bond yield rose to a 2-week high, strengthening the yen’s interest rate differentials.  A slump in the Nikkei Stock Index to a 2-1/2 month low today also boosted safe-haven demand for the yen.  Weaker-than-expected Japanese economic news today initially put pressure on the yen.
The Japan Jun tertiary industry index fell -0.4% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.2% m/m.
Japan Jul exports fell -0.3% y/y, weaker than expectations of -0.2% y/y and the biggest decline in over two years.  Also, Jul imports fell -13.5% y/y, the biggest decline in 2-3/4 years.
Japan Jun core machine orders rose +2.7% m/m, weaker than expectations of +3.5% m/m.
October gold (GCV3) today is down -2.0 (-0.10%), and Sep silver (SIU23) is up +0.240 (+1.07%). Precious metals prices this morning are mixed, with gold falling to a 5-month low.  Higher global bond yields today are weighing on precious metals prices. Also, fund liquidation in gold continues after long gold holdings in ETFs fell to a 3-1/3 year low on Tuesday.   Losses in gold are limited due to a weaker dollar.  Silver price also found support on today’s stronger-than-expected U.S. economic news on weekly jobless claims and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey, which is positive for economic growth prospects and industrial metals demand.

James Dwyer -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, and good day, everyone. I'm joined today by Roy Harvey, Alcoa Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer; and William Oplinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions after comments by Roy and Bill.
As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements relating to future events and expectations that are subject to various assumptions and caveats. Factors that may cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation and in our SEC filings.
In addition, we have included some non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the appendix to today's presentation. Any reference in our discussion today to EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. Finally, as previously announced, the earnings release and slide presentation are available on our website.
With that, here's Roy.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jim. And thanks to everyone for joining our call. It is a real pleasure to present Alcoa's excellent first quarter. As you can see from our release, our results were strong on both the top and bottom lines with our strongest results since the record-setting year in 2018. I'm very happy with the progress we've made at Alcoa on multiple fronts, particularly this quarter. As the world's economies continue to spin up from the lows of last year's pandemic-induced lockdowns, we are capturing the benefits of stronger markets. We are delivering the customers the sustainable materials they need to meet improved demand. Importantly, we are operating safely and reliably, demonstrating the same kind of relentless discipline that helped guide us through more turbulent times. Bill will discuss the financial results in more detail, but I'd like to take the opportunity to characterize our most important achievements.
We had a net income of $175 million or $0.93 per share. On a year-over-year basis, this is more than double the $80 million in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted net income was $150 million, which more than tripled last quarter's $49 million. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, was $521 million, a 44% increase sequentially. And significantly, we finished the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash on hand. I'm proud of the work our team is doing to drive each of these results. As Alcoans, we never shy away from getting the hard work done, working inclusively and remaining focused on executing against our goals. Our company is getting better and stronger, and this was certainly the case in the first quarter.
Before we get into the details though, I want to emphasize again that Alcoa always places an emphasis on our values and our strategic priorities, regardless of market conditions. The COVID-19 crisis has served as a strong pressure test. When the pandemic hit last year, Alcoa was well prepared to implement rigorous processes to protect our people and support our communities, keep our operations running, and preserve and generate cash. Today, our values and our strategic priorities are working to keep us on track and to help drive positive results. Most importantly, we had no fatal or serious injuries in the quarter. The safety of our workforce, whether employees or contractors, is always our most important responsibility, and our teams continue to make progress in using proactive tools to keep all of our people safe.
In the first quarter, we also continued to make progress on our strategy, accomplishing several key actions. First, we successfully closed on the $670 million sale of the Warrick rolling mill in Indiana, a non-core asset. That sale, combined with the Gum Springs sale last year, put us at the top of our target of between $500 million and $1 billion for non-core asset sales, although we will continue to pursue other opportunities where it makes sense.
Last month, in our Aluminum segment, we reached an agreement to repower the Portland Aluminium smelter in Australia. Our agreements with multiple power providers and the Australian government will improve the smelter's competitiveness and also help provide reliability to the electric grid in the State of Victoria. Also, our strong cash position, coupled with a favorable debt market, provided Alcoa an opportunity to pre-fund certain pension obligations and pay off higher interest rate debt via $500 million debt issuance at a 4.125% interest rate. This was the lowest rate debt we've ever issued as an independent company.
Earlier this month, we retired in full the $750 million senior notes that were due in 2024, which were issued at a 6.75% coupon. In April, we also contributed $500 million to our US pension plans, improving our funded status. These actions position Alcoa for minimal cash outflows for debt repayment, or pension contributions for the next several years. This provides added optionality to use future excess free cash for items aligned with our capital allocation framework, and Bill will discuss more about this in a moment.
We are also seeing stronger markets, markets that are evolving to reflect the key issues facing our planet. We are fortunate that aluminum is a sustainable solution to help solve many challenges due to its inherent qualities. It is lightweight, strong, durable and infinitely recyclable. We are also extremely well positioned to meet our customers' demands for sustainably produced products. As a company with an integrated upstream aluminum value chain, we have a distinct advantage to differentiate with sustainably produced bauxite, alumina and aluminum. And additionally, we already have the industry's most comprehensive portfolio of low-carbon products through our Sustana family, which includes the industry's first and only low-carbon smelter grade alumina product.
Finally, an important point to consider for the future is China's evolving role in the global aluminum industry. We have been encouraged to see the strict discipline now evident in their issuance and enforcement of operating permits that comply with their supply side reforms and environmental targets. And over these last months, it is obvious that the country, with the world's largest capacity in aluminum, is working to reduce its carbon footprint with increasing impacts on today's and tomorrow's aluminum operations. Alcoa is ready to win in this rapidly changing world, with improving markets, increased environmental discipline in China and our strong ESG focus in upstream aluminum industry.
With that, let's get straight to the results. Bill, please go ahead.
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Roy. First, before diving into what was a very good quarter financially and operationally, let's cover the four important strategic actions taken in March and early April, wherein we significantly improved our cash, debt maturity profile and liquidity position. First, in early March, we issued at 4.125% $500 million of eight-year bonds maturing in 2029. Second, at the end of March, we closed on the Warrick rolling mill sale to Kaiser Aluminum generating cash proceeds of approximately $600 million. These two actions took our cash balance to $2.5 billion on March 31. Thirdly, on April 1, we funded $500 million into our US pension plans. And lastly, on April 7, we called the entire $750 million of our 6.75% eight-year bonds maturing in 2024. On a pro forma basis, the net of these actions brings our cash balance to $1.3 billion, in line with our capital allocation framework target of retaining $1 billion cash on the balance sheet and eliminates all material debt maturities until 2026. These actions also significantly moved us toward meeting our adjusted proportional net debt target and created substantial pension funding flexibility.
We believe that our optimal capital structure and WACC is achieved with the proportional adjusted net debt of $2 billion to $2.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. We improved that metric over $700 million from year-end to $2.7 billion and just $200 million from the top of our target range. Further progress on achieving the net debt target could be made through reducing debt, lowering pension, OPEB net liability or increasing cash on hand.
The $500 million pension funding substantially improves the US pension and our overall pension position. Funded status for the US pensions moved from 81% at year-end to an estimate of greater than 95% on April 1 and creates a pre-funding balance of roughly $1 billion. Further, taken as a whole, our global pensions are estimated to be greater than 90% funded. The change in funded status benefits Alcoa in two ways. First, it allows us to de-risk the pension investment strategy. It reduces balance sheet volatility associated with both asset returns and discount rate changes. Second, it can free up future cash flows. Should we choose to direct cash flows to other uses or should funded status continue to improve, the pre-funding balance can be used to meet our expected minimum funding requirements for the US pensions.
Now, let's talk about the first quarter of 2021 in more detail. Revenues increased approximately $500 million, up 20% sequentially and 21% year-over-year on higher aluminum and alumina prices. Higher revenues translated into earnings per share of $0.93 per share on a GAAP basis or $0.79 per share after special items that include the gain on sale of the Warrick rolling mill.
Adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, was $521 million, up 44% sequentially and up 62%, compared to the first quarter of 2020. Looking at drivers of adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, the entire benefit in aluminum and alumina prices flow through to the bottom line. Unfavorable currency, higher energy prices and slightly lower seasonal shipments were totally offset by the resumption of shipments at the San Ciprian smelter and favorable inventory costs.
In the segments, Bauxite adjusted EBITDA was lower on the intercompany pricing change we announced in January, non-recurrence of a favorable contract true-up in the fourth quarter of 2020 and earnings at non-operated mines. Alumina more than doubled, up $130 million sequentially to $227 million on higher alumina prices and lower bauxite cost. Aluminum improved 56% to $283 million in the first quarter, primarily due to higher metal prices, slightly offset by higher alumina costs.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Working capital usually increases in the first quarter and excluding the impact of the Warrick rolling mill, days working capital increased five days sequentially to 25 days and improved four days compared to the year-ago quarter. Other key metrics also improved, as return on equity was 18.5% and the $2.5 billion cash balance helped to reduce our proportional adjusted net debt to $2.7 billion improving over $700 million from year-end 2020.
Free cash flow, less NCI distributions, was negative $131 million, reflecting the expected use of working capital in the first quarter, approximately $344 million. Cash sources of $1.6 billion are from nearly equal contributions from adjusted EBITDA, the rolling mill sale and the debt issue. Uses after working capital included capital expenditures of $75 million, cash income taxes of $71 million and pension/OPEB funding of $70 million, which does not include the $500 million funded April 1.
Our outlook for the year continues the trends set by our very good first quarter. Shipments are expected to remain at high levels, supported by consistent production levels at the operations. We've increased the estimated full-year 2021 alumina shipments range by 100,000 tons. Several cost elements are expected to improve a total of $45 million on a full-year basis, with transformation costs better $5 million, non-operating pension and OPEB expense better $25 million and interest expense better $15 million. Cash flow impacts now note the additional US pension funding of $500 million made on April 1 and assume using the US pre-funding balance for the remainder of the year, and also note the debt repayment of $750 million made on April 7. All other cash flow impacts remain on track.
For the coming quarter, we will no longer have earnings from the Warrick rolling mill, which booked adjusted EBITDA of $14 million in the first quarter. However, we expect to see increased benefit from the current higher aluminum market prices and continued improvement in value-add aluminum shipments and prices. As is often the case, we expect that the second quarter will be our highest level of maintenance activity for the year, approximately $25 million higher than the first quarter and then return to a lower level in the third quarter. Also, based on current energy market conditions around the world, we expect an unfavorable impact of $20 million sequentially. Finally, we expect tax expense for the second quarter to be approximately $90 million. In summary, we are on track for an excellent year, consistent with a very good first quarter.
Now, let me turn it back to Roy.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Bill. Next, I'd like to highlight the improvements we're seeing across the fundamentals of our industry. Perhaps the easiest way to demonstrate the impact of these underlying changes is by examining the realized price for aluminum, which is the highest we've seen since 2018. As you can see, prices have continued a steady upward trend from the lows at the start of the global pandemic. The average realized price was up 36% since the low in the second quarter of 2020. Economic recovery, manufacturing restarts and tightness in the physical availability of aluminum have all contributed to this latest price rally. We have observed strong macroeconomic trends in the first quarter, including positive GDP and industrial production growth in many of the world's leading economies. Also, the announced and implemented monetary and fiscal stimulus programs have supported stronger demand in aluminum's end use markets, which is expected to continue as vaccination efforts progress, lockdowns are eased and additional stimulus measures reach further into the economy.
Now, turning to the right-hand side of the slide and our markets specifically. In aluminum, we saw an approximate 10% increase in shipments of value-add products during the first quarter. This was the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement for our metal cast in specific shapes for alloys. Also, we are seeing significant year-over-year growth in our order book for these value-add products. We currently expect value-add products to represent more than half of our shipments in 2021and to grow more than 20% year-over-year.
In alumina, the average API price for the quarter increased sequentially. Currently, however, high freight rates have pressured the alumina price. We expect our smelter grade alumina shipments to slightly increase in 2021. In bauxite, we saw lower sequential third-party segment revenue due to lower shipments. As I said last quarter, we expect full-year 2021 third-party bauxite shipments to increase as we continue to boost production.
Next, I'd like to spend a few moments on aluminum industry fundamentals, specifically with regard to China. Changing dynamics in this country have the potential to have a major impact on the global primary aluminum industry. Over the last 10 years, China increased its global production of aluminum, and this was particularly acute from 2011 to 2017, as its manufacturing sector grew at a breakneck pace with subsidized primary aluminum capacity. Many of these unfair subsidies continue today. However, growth has been lower over the last four to five years, due to a combination of slower development in manufacturing, as well as China's own supply side reforms. This includes strictly enforcing the capacity permit program with the cap at 45 million tons of annualized capacity and other constraints that will limit capacity in certain provinces.
Over the last year, China has announced other policies that could further impact the aluminum industry. It has set carbon dioxide reduction goals for the country, announcing last year targets of achieving a peak in emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. China has also announced its latest five-year plan to reduce by 18% its carbon intensity per unit of GDP by 2025. The plan includes carbon intensity targets for individual provinces. And we are already seeing these changes on the ground. Some provinces are preventing the launch of new energy-intensive industrial projects, including primary aluminum smelting in order to meet their targets, and others are canceling preferential power tariffs for smelters. We have seen this occur in two provinces. Inner Mongolia curtailed smelters and delayed or canceled projects. And Gansu canceled preferential smelter power tariffs.
In addition, the China Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Association announced in April a draft goal that calls for peaking emissions in the industry by 2025, five years ahead of the National Carbon Peak Goal, as well as a target to reduce by 40% industry carbon emissions by 2040.
Furthermore, China has launched its own National Emissions Trading scheme this year, which will first target the power industry, including captive power. It is likely that the next round will focus on emissions-intensive industries and include primary aluminum. Adding costs and supply restrictions to carbon emissions will be a challenge for China's domestic primary aluminum smelting industry, of which more than 80% is powered by coal. In fact, 5% of China's total carbon emissions come from the non-ferrous metals industry, the majority of which comes from primary aluminum smelting. To put that in perspective, China's primary aluminum industry alone produces a similar amount of carbon emissions each year as the entire country of Australia.
In summary, China's recent moves toward decarbonization have the potential to address persistent overcapacity in the country. Given the pressures and constraints in China, it is likely that we will see supply growth in the country slow even further as the primary aluminum industry there approaches its 45 million ton capacity cap, and that can drive significant positive change in the global aluminum industry's fundamentals.
China is not the only significant change occurring across our industry. Other global economies are also taken steps to transition to a carbon-constrained world. And our stakeholders are demanding rapid change when it comes to a broad range of ESG-related issues. And as I've noted previously, Alcoa is well positioned to meet the demands of this new sustainably focused world. Our Sustana line of low-carbon products is the most comprehensive in the aluminum industry and includes EcoSource, the world's first and only low-carbon smelter grade alumina product. We are the world's largest third-party provider of alumina, and our refining system also has the globe's lowest average carbon dioxide equivalents, something that we are leveraging with this differentiated product.
EcoSource supports decarbonizing aluminum, while expanding our Sustana line to the broader aluminum value chain. It offers no more than 0.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per metric ton of alumina, which is half of the global alumina industry's average carbon content, and our measurement includes direct and indirect emissions from mining and refining. We expect to make our first customer shipment of EcoSource alumina in May.
Meanwhile, we're also seeing additional demand for aluminum in our Sustana line and for metal certified by the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative. Alcoa has operations in all three of our segments certified to ASI's exacting standards, and we have earned both ASI's Performance and Chain of Custody Certification, which allow us to market ASI certified products across our value chain.
In March, we announced that metal from our joint venture ELYSIS and our low-carbon EcoLum, which is produced with no more than 4.0 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, is being used in the wheels of the Audi e-tron GT, the manufacturer's first electric sportscar. We supply the low-carbon aluminum to RONAL GROUP, which produced the wheels with EcoLum and an allocation of metal produced from the ELYSIS's zero-carbon smelting technology that we invented. That technology, which eliminates all greenhouse gases, is now being ramped up to a commercial scale by the ELYSIS joint venture.
While the market for low-carbon aluminum continues to develop, we are well positioned to fill the needs of a society calling for lower greenhouse gas emissions and customers who demand products that include assurances of responsible production. Whether it's electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels or battery technology, aluminum is an essential material for global economies that are working to address climate change and control carbon emissions. Carbon pricing initiatives are either in place now or being scheduled for implementation in 64 jurisdictions, including the European Union, Canada and China. And 31 countries in the EU have GHG reduction targets in place or net zero pledges. And here in the US, the Biden administration is making climate change a top priority. Alcoa has specific GHG reduction targets that align with the Paris climate accord, and we are well positioned for this important transition occurring in theglobal market
Next, I want to reinforce the tremendous progress we've made on our strategic priorities. At Alcoa, we have a relentless focus on continuous improvement. I'm impressed by our global team of employees, when we set aggressive goals we stretch to achieve them. Last year was the first full year working within the new operating model, which further streamlined our business. It delivered an annual run rate of $60 million in savings. Importantly, we have this in place before the pandemic, and the fact that we performed so well in a time of crisis demonstrates that we designed a system that can work well for the future. We can now count this action as fully completed and working effectively. We have also achieved our goal of generating between $500 million and $1 billion from the sale of non-core assets. With the Gum Springs sale last year and the Warrick rolling mill sale last month, we've completed this program finishing toward the top end of the target.
Finally, we've made progress in our portfolio review, which includes opportunities for significant improvement, curtailments, closures or divestitures. Last month, we were happy to reach new power agreements with the Portland aluminum smelter. We appreciate the collaboration with multiple power generators, the Australian Federal Government and the State of Victoria in working with us to help improve the smelter's competitiveness.
Also, we continue to work on solutions for the San Ciprian smelter in Spain. We agreed with the workers' representatives and the government to pursue an exclusive sales process with the Spanish government-owned entity. We've complied with that agreement and are working in good faith with all our stakeholders to find the best solution. It's important to note that we're now in the second year of this five-year portfolio review program, and we will continue to work as expeditiously as possible to provide clarity for our employees, communities and other stakeholders.
Finally, as we prepare to take your questions, I want to emphasize three major points to leave you with today. First, as Bill detailed, our balance sheet is solid, due to the numerous actions we've taken, including paying off higher interest rate debt and reducing our pension net liability, which has improved our net debt position. With no major cash outlays due in the foreseeable future and with significant cash on hand, we have much greater flexibility within our capital allocation frame.
Second, we've delivered on some key components on our strategic actions that have improved this company for the long term. We're doing exactly what we've said, improving Alcoa, so it can be successful through all market cycles. We will continue to drive for consistent improvements, that's the Alcoa away.
Third, we are working to define what it means to be a sustainable aluminum company, with best-in-class processes from mine to metal, the most comprehensive low-carbon products portfolio in the industry and the continued pursuit of operational excellence. We will continue to act with integrity, operate with excellence and care for people. All of this aligns too with our strategic priorities, including our work to advance sustainably.
Thanks for your attention. And Bill and I are now ready to welcome your questions. Operator?
Questions and Answers:
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.
Carlos De Alba -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Congratulations, Roy and Bill. Just the question -- first question is with a greater flexibility that you have achieved in your balance sheet and the cash balance that you have, how should we think about the priorities and what that flexibility -- what would you like to do with this flexibility? Any update on the growth projects in alumina or any other things that you might have in mind? And then if I may just ask, is it possible to quantify or to either qualitative or quantitative constructively the potential benefits of the renegotiated Portland smelter agreements for the energy cost? Thank you guys.
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Roy, do you want me to take the capital allocation question?
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Why don't you take it in general? And I can add a few comments at the end.
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So, Carlos, great question on capital allocation. Some of the moves that we've made this year and some of the tailwinds that we have in the market have really positioned the company to successfully execute on our capital allocation program. You saw the big decline in proportional net debt in the first quarter. That's largely due to the sale of the Warrick facility. So we've been able to get our proportional net debt down to $2.7 billion. Remember, we have a target range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
So when we look at capital allocation program, there's four key areas for allocation of excess free cash flow. The first is proportional -- we are continuing to make improvements on proportional net debt. I would tell you that, that has been a focus area for us, and it will continue to be a primary focus for us. And I also believe that we should be able to get within our target range this year.
Secondly, and these are not necessarily in rank order. We've got returns to shareholders. We've got the continued actions on the portfolio review. And then lastly, the midsized growth projects that we've talked about in the past. I'll address the last one. At this point, the midsized growth projects, specifically in Australia and Brazil refining, are currently on hold. They were put on hold in 2020. We will reevaluate those projects over time. But at this point, those are on hold. So those are the priorities for our capital allocation. We've made great progress on the debt reduction. I think we'll continue to make great progress on the debt reduction in today's market environment and that's how we're moving forward.
As far as the Portland transaction goes, I'm really pleased to be able to repower Portland. It's a great facility, really strong workforce, good strong technology, and we've not released details about the power contract. In today's market environment, it's a very strong facility, but I really can't quantify anything much more than that for you, Carlos. Other than the fact that it is one of the assets that was under portfolio review and now that we've got it repowered, we're really pleased that facility has a future for the next five years.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
And, Carlos, if I can just add a couple of quick comments because I completely agree with Bill. On Portland, I think one of the -- one of my favorite things about this announcement was the fact that during this portfolio review, we've been trying to be very clear that there is a number of potential outcomes, and it's really good to see us be able to put in place this five-year deal for our facility that's so strong and is competitive now with that improved power price as Portland. So, I think just a really great example of what you can do when you have on power providers and governments and a company and workforce that's looking to try and make an improvement.
And on the capital allocation question, again, I think Bill hit it right on. I think we're -- I'm just incredibly pleased that we've been able to make so much progress, particularly on improving the net debt target that we had. And even through the midst of the pandemic, we've also been able to move forward and work on our portfolio restructuring. We've been able to take real steps that really helps to build optionality for us. And so, I would say in coming out of first quarter and the rest of 2021 stretching in front of us, we're really well positioned with a lot of great options in front of us.
Carlos De Alba -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Sorry.
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And if I could just tag on one more comment, Carlos. We talked about the proportional net debt. But underneath the proportional net debt, you've got the debt side and pension. It should be apparent to everyone through this press release that our pension situation is markedly better today than it has been since we were an independent company. Our global pension systems are greater than 90% funded. Our US pension system is greater than 95% funded. And the fact that we pre-funded an additional $500 million gives us $1 billion pre-funding balance that essentially eliminates the need to make contributions to the US pensions through 2025. And that's all assuming today's interest rates and today's asset returns you can never count on that staying the same, but as we look forward, that frees up significant cash flow. If you simply compare the amount of cash that we're projecting today versus what was in the most recent 10-K. If we use our pre-funding balance, it reduces our cash requirements by a couple of hundred million dollars a year over the next few years. So it gives us a lot of flexibility. It gets us very close to our net debt target and just strengthens the company.
Carlos De Alba -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
All right. Very impressive results. And clearly open up space for potential dividends or share buybacks. So great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Good luck.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Carlos.
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Carlos.
Operator
Our next question will come from Alex Hacking with Citi.
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So I'll address the second one first, and that will give time to -- Roy can address the alumina market question, Alex. To put the asset sales in perspective, we committed to $500 million to $1 billion. We achieved over $800 million of proceeds between Gum Springs and Warrick. So we're going to put a big check mark besides the target of having $500 million to $1 billion. But as you alluded to, we still have Rockdale land down in Texas, roughly 30,000 acres where it's got a list price of $250 million. We're actively pursuing potential opportunities there. So very interested in getting that asset sold.
And on top of that, we have a group of people who look at really the assets around the periphery, some of our closed and curtailed assets to try to maximize value. So maybe, there is some smaller asset sales that are out there as potential. And then, you specifically mentioned the hydros down in Brazil. At this point, we're pretty happy with our hydro position in Brazil. So, we'll probably continue owning those at this point. So, Roy, do you want to address the aluminum market question?
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Bill. And I appreciate the question, Alex. Just a few quick points, and particularly looking at China, but also sort of looking a bit further afield as well. First from a short-term perspective, and I know we hit some of this in the presentation, we are seeing with increasing freight rates and the balance of pricing between China and the rest of the world. We're not seeing a large window of arbitrage opportunity for taking tons into China. So when you think about how those prices have been set and the fact that we've been relatively flat for these last months while the aluminum prices have been going up, it's really just the fact that we have both supply and demand relatively balanced.
And the good thing about the aluminum market is that you get a lot of transparency and you can see those transactions occurring. When you look out a bit and think about what will happen from the supply side, particularly inside of China, again, I think the supply side reforms in aluminum have been very well explained. I mean, we've seen a lot of enforcement in country as to what China has decided to do. There's always a possibility that they look to try and drive those same types of changes into alumina. But right now, there is really not any explanation of where that piece of the industry is going, so not a lot of clarity.
However, when you think about really two trends that I wanted to highlight. The first is the fact that you're getting more and more transparency about environmental issues and environmental management certainly around the world, but also inside of China. And so, when you think of the importance of how you manage and handle bauxite residue and it's one of the things that we put a lot of emphasis on to make sure that we're doing that with the best methodology across the business, you're seeing more and more transparency inside of China, and that means that it tends to ensure that the global competitiveness is its level of playing field as possible.
The other side is, and this will continue to be a big influence inside of the Chinese alumina industry. Because of the dwindling bauxite reserves, the fact is they're importing more and more bauxite. That creates the bauxite -- import bauxite industry, which as we do sell into. But more importantly, it tends to steepen the cost curve because now you're competing and most of our facilities, although not all are co-located very close to the reserve itself, the bauxite reserve itself. When you're importing, you then have that exposure both to freight rates, but also to just the cost of mining elsewhere and then importing it. So, it tends to be supportive of driving some steepness inside of that cost curve.
So when I look across that, China has become a very strong competitor and has grown its alumina business quite a bit. And it's I think something that offers us opportunities and also gives us a moment to see how we can ensure that our refineries are as competitive as they possibly can be and watch how that market continues in the future.

Our next question comes from Lucas Pipes with B Riley Securities.
Lucas Pipes -- B Riley Securities -- Analyst
Hey, good afternoon, everyone. And I'd like to add my congratulations. One number that stood out to me, in particular, is the ROE of 18.5%. So, congratulations on that. And some of the questions we already had kind of touched on levers ways to continue to improve that metric. And I wanted to ask, maybe a little bit more open-ended that you've done a great job of optimized assets, you sold assets. From here on out, how do you continue to drive that figure higher? Thank you very much.
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Lucas, thanks for the question. I appreciate that you noticed the 18.5%. One of the things about our company, as all of you know, we have a joint venture partnership in the bauxite and the alumina business. We also have a somewhat complex tax situation where we pay taxes in Australia, but in many places around the world with net operating losses that we have, we don't have to reserve for future taxes on profitability. That ends up resulting in a quarter like this, where you see strength in the earnings in the aluminum business really all falling to the bottom line. And so, in a marketplace where we're seeing metal prices greater than $2,300, our aluminum smelting business really shines and drives the profitability to the bottom line, and that's what you see in that ROE calculation.
Before I get to what's next and I'll actually let Roy address what's next, it shouldn't get lost in the first quarter results, the strength of the operations that we've had all through 2020 through the pandemic and into the first quarter of 2021. When you look at the bridge that I showed in the presentation, we're making the volumes that we need to make, and we're making cost improvements on top of that. And so, in a market that's got good strong tailwinds to be able to make the tons as stably, as predictably and as safely as we have been doing and also deliver on cost savings, just a tremendous amount of credit goes to our operations team and our operations around the world.
So, Roy, do you want to address some of the things that we would be looking at next?
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. And you hit really what was going to be my first point, which is how strong the foundation that stability of operations can give us as we think about building on top of that and trying to drive what comes next from a -- really from a return standpoint. We have -- we try to take a pretty longer cycle view of how we approach our investments and also try and make sure that we can explain that very carefully, both internally, but also of course to our investors and externally. So we try to make sure that we're not simply reacting to the most recent developments in our market, but also trying to think a bit longer term. And I think it's particularly important given how much -- how many changes we're seeing in the market, not only when you look at some of the things we talked about with China over the course of this last -- over this last 40 minutes, but also when you think about this low-carbon evolution and the expectation for responsible production that we have embedded into the Alumina Stewardship Initiative and some other work that we are doing. So it offers a lot of opportunities.
And when you look across the portfolio and you think about how can we drive great returns across the product lines that we have -- you've got the ELYSIS partnership, which is developing, which I think is a great opportunity, although still a bit far out because it's in the midst of research and development. But also along the lines and across aluminum, when you look at some of the most competitive plants where you have real support both from a pricing standpoint and from a desire to have that industry and country, I think you still have creep opportunities in order to drive relatively small and modest projects, but will be able to drive further production and you build that on top of the stability and with a great center of excellence like we have in our aluminum group.
Alumina is another place where -- and Bill mentioned a little while ago, we've got medium-sized projects that we can bring to bear. Again, we need to have confidence that the market is going to support that. We need to make sure that the capital costs are as low as possible because it is a very competitive market out there, and we want to bring everything that we can from a center of excellence perspective, technological perspective, but then also make good use of the bauxite itself. But really good opportunities there. That again is a great way for us to be able to drive earnings. And in bauxite -- and I realize bauxite pricing has been a little bit weaker over the course of this last -- these last few months. But we have great reserves, we have a real opportunity in order to consider growing those mines if we find that we have the right customer and the right pricing environment and the right long-term certainty to be able to bring that to bear.
So it's -- there's a lot of ways that we can work to make this company better. I think you've seen a lot of those demonstrated through the work on our net debt position. You've seen it demonstrated in the fact that we can operate our plants stably. And again, that's work of everybody, but I think you're also going to see that we can be very disciplined in how we choose to deploy capital to make sure that we can actually drive value for our shareholders, and as one lever across all of the capital allocation levers that Bill had talked about as well.
Lucas Pipes -- B Riley Securities -- Analyst
I really appreciate the very detailed answer. Thank you. I have a quick follow-up on the value-add products and the opportunity there. It seems like pretty impressive growth. Can you share with us the spend capital in that segment, or is that really just a very strong manufacturing recovery that we're seeing with you adding more value-add products? And from here on out, what do you think is the growth potential for that product? Thank you.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Value-added wise, I think the improvements that you're seeing now really is the benefits of the return in our markets. And so, when you look across, and particularly, in Europe, North America, you are seeing a lot of demand returning. I mean, as vaccinations continue to be rolled out, as you see manufacturers get back and you've seen that downstream demand come into place. I think we're seeing just a lot of strength. And so from that perspective, it's really a matter of getting back to where we should be and really making good use of the facilities that are already in place.
When we look to the future, I mean that's, of course, going to depend a bit on how the recovery progresses. And I think we always need to be cognizant that there can be surprises in both directions, both positive and negative, but we can also consider how we try and creep forward value-added. There is always targeted investments that we can make. They tend to be very modest compared with the investments that we would put in, for example, in creeping a smelter or in driving new production in a refinery.
However, we need to -- we would need to make sure that we've got both the molten metal available in order to produce them or a scrap input if we were to choose to try and use some scrap or find a good business case to make sure that it would be sensible in order to drive more value-added. So it's certainly additional possibilities that sit inside of that and it's something that we continuously review. It's -- one of the benefits of our portfolio across the world is that we are in some very vibrant value-added product markets. Now, those have been a lot of changes over these last couple of years with some additional inputs, etc. And also with some of the programs 232 tariffs, etc. that you've seen that have altered some of those product flows. But we always try and look through that, and again, look for the long term, so that we can actually see a good positive outcome for any investment that we'd actually put into place.

Our next question will come from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets.
David Gagliano -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of them have already been covered. But I just -- I want to -- I'm just going to press a little bit on the capital return or capital allocation policy. Obviously, a lot of progress and great commentary regarding potential down the road, as well as the pre-funding of the pension already. So you know really the question is, at this point, it's been danced around a bit, but should equity shareholders expect dividends in 2021 at this point?
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Dave, I don't think we're going to comment on whether they should expect dividends. What I would say is, given the current market situation I think we can get our targeted net-debt situation within our target range of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And after that, the goal will be to maintain it in that level and then allocate capital between the three other prongs of the capital allocation model.
David Gagliano -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
All right. I thought I give it a try. All right. And then just on the additional business consideration. Obviously, you called out a lot of what looks like really kind of one-timers in the second quarter for higher seasonal maintenance and energy-related costs. As we think about the third quarter, are there any offsets to simply assuming that those just go away in the third quarter, all the ones that are called out as one-timers? Is there anything that we should be thinking about that some that's going to bleed into the third quarter?
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. As you know, we'll give third-quarter guidance at the beginning of the third quarter. But I think the point you're making is a strong one, and that is the fact that we've tried to make it pretty clear that the $20 million of seasonal maintenance in the Alumina segment is truly the high point of maintenance in the year is in the second quarter. And that it rebounds -- declines in the third quarter. And the same on the $5 million in the Aluminum Smelting segment. We would typically see some maintenance in the second quarter, but we're anticipating that to go away in the third quarter. And obviously, the Warrick rolling mill sale, we lose those earnings because we've sold that asset. But if I would kind of summarize the second quarter, we do have some of these one-time items, but we do have some really strong market tailwinds behind us with metal price as high as it is, with Midwest premiums or regional premiums around the globe besides they are. And the value-add products business both from a volume side and pricing has been very strong. So our anticipation is that the second quarter should be a good quarter in [Indecipherable], but also we need to consider these items that we talked about here.
David Gagliano -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Understood. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Our next question will come from John Tumazos with Very Independent Research.
John Tumazos -- Very Independent Research LLC -- Analyst
Thank you. Congratulations on the good times and the earnings.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John.
John Tumazos -- Very Independent Research LLC -- Analyst
It's been a little while since the new smelter in Iceland and the participation in Saudi Arabia and the refinery and bauxite in Saudi Arabia and Juruti, bauxite in Brazil. Is there an appetite for a project. If it were a smelter would you be building a wind farm or would you be comparing solar and tax productivities in the Sinai Desert versus Arabia, the Sahara, the Kalahari, the Sonoran, West Texas and other deserts? Would you do a renewable smelter integrated into sun or wind?
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, John. So I'll take that one. And it's looking a bit forward into the future and I appreciate that. We as always, I would step and look to see how the markets are changing in order to imagine what that future looks like. We don't have any significant growth projects that are currently lined up. And when we do we'll certainly announce that to the broader world. That said, when you think about what the future and particularly in smelting is going to be, it is almost definitely going to be one that has a dedicated renewable power source. I don't think we as Alcoa would be imagining to do both power side and the smelter side, but I just don't see a non-renewable smelter coming into -- being on the table, either for us or for most of the industry.
And when you step back and also think about the revolutionary technology that's being developed in ELYSIS right now and again, there's still work that needs to be done in order to make that a viable option for the future. It's also I think a pretty exciting opportunity that we would always be evaluating before we chose to build that next new facility, to be quite honest. And again, just one step backward, as we always try and look across the market and think about how we see those trends developing, the advantage of ELYSIS is that it has operational cost improvements because you no longer need to have an anode facility. You have the opportunity to be more productive in the same footprint, but we're also trying to make sure that it is very competitive on a capital cost perspective. And really in the capital cost side is where you need to make sure that given the trends that are happening in the market, you're connected to a renewable power source that gives us the opportunity to you take advantage of the low carbon market. But if you were then to put in ELYSIS technology, it would make it the cleanest and greenest aluminum on the planet.
So to me, it's great, great places for us to be analyzing it for the future and I think it's going to be an exciting time. But right now, nothing to specifically announce.
John Tumazos -- Very Independent Research LLC -- Analyst
Thank you.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, John.
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
John, if I could just add sense to that. One thing to keep in mind is that [Indecipherable] is going to be powered by wind in part in the future. So we've signed a series of wind contracts. So as you and I look back at the history of this industry over the last 10 or 20 years, who would have thought that a smelter would be wind-powered, but we will have a smelter that is in large part wind-powered going into the future.

Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America.
Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Hi, guys. Hope you're doing well.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Timna.
Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks. I want to ask two questions. One is just if you are in our shoes, how would you think about modeling green aluminum. Is it just a talking point or niche business? Is there a way to quantify that opportunity in your mind that you could guide us to?
And then my second question is just, do you think we're approaching any incentive pricing for restarts or new capacity when you add together the aluminum price and regional premiums or do you think that global costs have risen enough to where that's not in reach yet? Thanks.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
So let me take a first swing at the green aluminum point, and then maybe Bill can add his thoughts too. The way that we try to look at the green aluminum market it's -- and as you can imagine, it's just in the midst of growing. So it's hard to see exactly what it's going to look like. And so it's hard to develop what does that model look like. The fact is, is that one of the points we've been trying to make is that there should be a differentiation in levels of green aluminum rather than just fixing one particular point you -- I want to make sure that the market understands that when you look at the value chain coming up to aluminum, including bauxite and alumina, and how you choose to produce those products. But then also the direct emissions content inside of aluminum as well, which helps to make sure that as customers are thinking about the carbon content of their portfolios, they are thinking of that entire aluminum value chain. And for Alcoa, as you can imagine that's important to us.
How to model it? I think it's -- in my view, we're seeing those premiums start to develop today. I think because it's such a new market, they don't necessarily represent what that future can look like. And the more you can think about how you differentiate those products, the more potential and opportunity that lies inside of that green aluminum. And it needs to be connected with the broader expectations around cost of carbon and carbon taxes that might be built around the world. And so it's certainly not an easy modeling exercise at all. But again, I think one thing I would embed into it is the fact that not all aluminum companies are the same and not every green aluminum is going to be the same as well.
I don't know, Bill, if you would have any other thoughts about how to model it?
William F. Oplinger -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No. I mean it's a small market at this point, right, Roy. And it's just starting to grow. I was just talking to some of the folks in our marketing group today and they're really starting to see a pull from specific customers, and it's just building now. Pull from specific -- I can speak, specific customers that really are starting to understand the possibilities of green aluminum and -- but it's a small market at this point, Timna.
Hey Timna, you asked about -- go ahead.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
No. I was just going to start on the incentive capacity and new capacity -- or really restarted capacity could come on line. I think, you're certainly seeing a stronger market today. You're starting to see some raw material inflation, but not a significant amount yet, although certainly that changes quarter-on-quarter. I look at our portfolio, which obviously is what we have inside of our control. Each of those smelters has its own set of gives and takes and challenges that might be there. And that would be the technology of the smelter in question, the availability of power, whether it is renewable power or the content in that power itself and how long of a runway that you can build for it because as you can imagine, bringing the plant back from a curtailed state can be expensive, and it can also take some time.
So, it's -- when Alcoa reviews it, it's not just about where pricing sits today, but really what are the basis for that price to continue. And more importantly, as you look through the cycle, and I wouldn't hazard to guess where we sit in the cycle today. When you look through that cycle, we want to make sure that that can be a competitive and profitable enterprise. But as you can imagine, we -- it's something that we continuously look at. We continuously look at to make sure that all of our plants are competitive in generating good profits in today's world, but we also look at the plans that we could bring back up again if we were to choose to.
Timna Tanners -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
So you're saying you're not planning to bring anything back at these prices. Is that what I should take away from that comment?
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
No. I think you should take away that we would analyze it. And when we make a decision to bring something back, we would absolutely tell you, Timna. I wasn't meaning to infer it in one direction or another.
Carlos De Alba -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs.
Emily Chieng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hey guys, congratulations on a great quarter. I wanted to touch a little bit on sort of the progress with the portfolio restructuring review here. We've certainly seen some updates on San Ciprian and Portland, but there's clearly still capacity under review. It sounds like from your last comments that the high metal price environment doesn't necessarily change any of this thinking and everything still under consideration heal. But when should we think about maybe sharing the next update in the sort of 3.5-year program to go?
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
So I think you hit a lot of the most important points, Emily. It's a program that takes time because each of these facilities -- and look at the Portland is a good example. We've been working on Portland now for more than two years. And so as you think about trying to make structural change -- and as you know, we don't talk about those plans that we haven't announced, particularly part of the portfolio review. As you look at those changes, as you look at those step changes in the competitive cost structure, sometimes it can take time for that actually to happen. And it's not something we talk about in the market.
So Portland is now behind us. As you know, San Ciprian is in the midst of negotiations right now with the state-owned entity to see if we can do a divestiture of that plant. Outside of that, there's no particular timeline for when we would make different decisions about any of the other plants in the portfolio. We still have the expectation and have some tons remaining in that program, as you well know. We'll be announcing that when the time comes and when we actually see that we can take action on each of those facilities.
Emily Chieng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Great. That's helpful. And if I can squeeze one last question in. Just around the carbon pricing, I know you guys put a great slide out on that, but any early impacts or signs of that starting to flow through in your operations and how you might be thinking about sort of the aluminum outlook going forward?
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So right now, I think, on the product side, low-carbon products, you are starting to see some sales and you saw our first EcoSource sale, which is the alumina product and then also some sales and ECOLUM, etc. And so that has a positive impact on the product side. On carbon taxes and carbon prices and how they're impacting, I think there is indirect impact that happens inside of the aluminum pricing environment itself and perhaps even into the regional premiums, depending on what the different efforts might be there. So to me, because there's so much talk about carbon pricing and where this will take us in the knock-on impact on the industry, I think you can see those indirect impacts already inside of some of the pricing environment that we're experiencing today. I'm not sure that's a bit of a squishy answer, but I think that's the best I can do.
Emily Chieng -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
That is really helpful color. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.
Michael Dudas -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst
Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. So Roy, just maybe a follow-up on Timna's thought on restarting capacity. There's been expectations from investors that have seen for years, aluminum supply would be a lot easier to bring on to the marketplace relative to say other nonferrous metals and such. But given what you talked about in China and the fact that this renewable power is probably going to be somewhat tight capacity given what the use of that is going to be around the world because everybody wants to decarbonize. Do you think that that growth curve has really flattened out quite a bit? Is it going to take a longer period of time for supply to catch up to whatever the demand growth is in this industry? Is that what we're starting to see emerge given the confluence of environmental, decarbon and some of the issues that you mentioned in China?
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Michael, let me try and answer that and then give me some feedback if I'm missing the point. I think, in general, bringing facilities out of curtailment is a pretty difficult enterprise. It's costly. It requires significant negotiations in order to reopen your power contract or to find the way to -- outside of just the pricing environment, which can come and go, be quite honest, while we always assume it's going to be a positive future, I think you need to -- everyone would need to consider that.
And in the end, and as we look at it from an Alcoa perspective, we need to make sure that when you curtail a facility, there is a reason for it. And when you would think about bringing back on again, there would need to be a reason as well. And again, it takes time. It is risky in the sense that you need to have a lot of experience about how to restart those facilities. So I think it's actually pretty difficult from an Alcoa perspective, again, to make a decision in order to bring that facility up again.
That said, from -- and again, I look at it from how we approach our facilities. We look for opportunities in curtailed facilities to see if there is a way to address some of the underlying problems that might be there. Is there a power contract that can be renegotiated or are there enough impacts that are going to be taken? It just takes time. And again, I think it's -- we're very careful not just to look at today's prices, but really to look forward at least 12, 18 or more months because of the time it we take in order to pay back that investment.
Michael Dudas -- Vertical Research Partners -- Analyst
That's a fair answer, Roy. I appreciate that because it seems like others in the industry will probably be having those, if not even more difficult decisions relative to what -- how you guys have been able to run your business? Thank you.
Roy C. Harvey -- President and Chief Executive Officer

3622.0,2022-04-21 00:00:00 UTC,"Top Stock Market News For Today April 21, 2022",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-stock-market-news-for-today-april-21-2022,,,"Stock Market Futures Gain As More Positive Earnings Roll In
U.S. stock futures are on the rise following yesterday’s mixed session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, in particular, is seeing somewhat of a recovery rally following its notable 1.22% drop during the previous session. Overall, it appears that the stock market remains volatile as investors continue to digest the current batch of earnings. Even with positive earnings, broad-based headwinds continue to plague companies across the board. This could, arguably, weigh in on outlooks for the short-to-mid-term.
Providing an overview of all this is Deepak Puri, Deutsche Bank’s (NYSE: DB) wealth management chief investment officer. Puri starts by saying, “The big question is whether the earnings can really sustain this kind of a macro backdrop of slower growth and [tighter] Fed policy.” He continues, “It seems certain companies can — historically that’s been the case. What’s different this time is really the trifecta, which is higher costs of capital, quantitative tightening, plus a lack of … a big fiscal stimulus.”
While this may seem daunting, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan did recently note that consumer spending remains strong. In his words, “They are a very strong force and you can see them very healthy. Their loan balances are down, they have plenty of borrowing capacity and they have plenty of spending capacity.” As investors look to make sense of all this, there remains plenty of stock market earnings news to consider today. As of 5:25 a.m. ET, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are trading higher by 0.58%, 0.77%, and 1.14% respectively.
Tesla Rallies Following Stellar First-Quarter Earnings Report
Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is among the top head turners in the stock market today. Notably, this is thanks to the company revealing its latest quarterly financials. In it, Tesla seems to be seeing green across the board. For starters, the company is looking at an earnings per share of $3.22. For reference, this handily beats Wall Street estimates of $2.26. Moreover, the electric vehicle (EV) titan raked in a total revenue of $18.76 billion for the quarter, also above consensus forecasts of $17.8 billion.
Going into the specifics, Tesla’s strong momentum on the automotive sales front is likely to thank for this stellar performance. For the quarter, the company’s automotive revenue is $16.86 billion. This translates to a whopping 87% year-over-year increase. According to Tesla, its automotive gross margins soared to 32.9%. By and large, all of this comes as no surprise seeing as Tesla continues bolstering its manufacturing capacities worldwide. In fact, just earlier this month, the company posted its second consecutive quarter with record deliveries. For a sense of scale, Tesla’s quarterly deliveries for Q1 2022 are currently at 310,048 units.
Sure, CEO Elon Musk may be making headlines for his current bid to take over Twitter (NYSE: TWTR). But Tesla does not seem to be slowing down in the least bit. Over the past month, the company celebrated the opening of two new mega factories. These would be its Giga Berlin and Giga Texas facilities. Despite inflationary and supply chain pressures, Tesla is working hard to localize production, optimize its operations, and speed up distribution. As a result of all this, I could see TSLA stock making headlines in the stock market today.

United Airlines Expects 2022 Return To Profit As Flight Ticket Prices Soar
At the same time, United Airlines (NASDAQ: UAL) seems to be taking off amongst its airline industry peers today. For the most part, this comes after United provided an upbeat outlook for the current fiscal year. Before going into that, a quick look at the company’s financials for the quarter. United posted a quarterly loss of $4.24 per share, below consensus forecasts of a $4.22 loss. Additionally, United’s total revenue for the quarter is currently at $7.57 billion. This too is just shy of analyst estimates of $7.68 billion.
Despite the seemingly lackluster results, United’s recovery from its pandemic era should not be overlooked. The company’s total revenue is up by over 135% year-over-year. More importantly, United is currently expecting to turn a profit in 2022. The company cites immense momentum across business travel and leisure bookings. In the words of CEO Scott Kirby, “I’ve never seen in my career, and I’ve been in this industry a long time … such a hockey stick increase of demand.” For the current quarter, United is guiding for a 10% operating margin and its highest quarterly sales to date. As such, it is no wonder that UAL stock is taking the lead among the top airline stocks now.

Procter & Gamble Beat Earnings Forecasts; Hikes Prices To Combat Inflation
In other earnings-related news, Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) is also in focus after posting commendable quarterly results. Diving in, the company saw earnings of $1.33 per share on revenue of $19.38 billion. To put things into perspective, consensus analyst expectations stand at $1.29 and $18.73 billion respectively. While PG’s margins continue to feel the pinch from rising commodity and freight costs, the company is adapting accordingly. It is doing so via a combination of product price hikes and productivity savings.
On the operational side of things, PG is also seeing consistent growth across its core product segments. Firstly, both its fabric & home-care and baby, feminine & family-care divisions saw organic sales growth (OSG) of 10%. In particular, its Tide brand detergent is looking at a double-digit increase in sales. Secondly, the company’s grooming segment, covering its Gillette razors, saw OSG of 8%. Thirdly, PG’s beauty division is also up by 3% in this respect.
Looking forward, PG also seems to be confident regarding its ability to navigate these challenging times. Namely, the company is raising its revenue growth forecast to a range of 4% to 5%. This would mark a notable increase from its previous outlook of a 3% to 4% increase. Seeing as PG continues to power forward, PG stock could be in focus at today’s stock market open.

1808.0,2011-01-20 00:00:00 UTC,Is This the Ultimate Buy-and-Hold Stock?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ultimate-buy-and-hold-stock-2011-01-20,,,"As investors continually seek out new investment ideas, it can get very tiresome. Just when you've found certain appealing stocks, they move up to your price target or lose operating momentum, and you're compelled to find the next idea. But what if you could hold a stock for the whole year, a whole decade or even a whole generation?
Well, that's how people used to invest. My grandmother boughtshares of AT&T (NYSE: T ) in the 1950s -- and never sold them. Thedividend income was surely appealing. And thecapital appreciation helped her stay well ahead of the forces ofinflation . But if my Grandma were alive today, would she still be able to find a ""forever stock?"" After all, in recent years, even stalwarts such as AT&T have lost their luster: Ma Bell'sshares have fallen by half since 2002.
You can still find ""forever stocks"" if you know where to look. The key ingredient is to seek out companies with long operating histories, that sell goods or services that won't become obsolete, and routinely generate solid rates of return on their deployed capital.
Of course, if it is to be a core holding, you'll have to avoid companies subject to wild cyclical swings such as Alcoa (NYSE: AA ) , Deere & Co. (NYSE: DE ) and JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ) . Those companies are likely to be around -- and flourish -- for many decades to come, but they'll give you plenty of indigestion along the way. You also want to find companies that can handle external impacts such asinflation . They must show the ability to raise prices whenever their own costs rise.
For example, Yum Brands (NYSE: YUM ) has seen itsshares rise steadily for more than 15 years. The fast-food operator is truly becoming a global name with its KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants opening around the world. That means the company is truly tied to the globe and not just the United States. Fearinginflation ? These value-oriented chains would hold even greater consumer appeal if rising prices deter people from eating at pricier restaurants.
The ultimate rain or shine stock
There's one thing that's bound to never change: people always need shelter. They can look to buy a home or spruce up their existing home. Or they can look to rent a place if home ownership doesn't appeal. And no matter where they live, people dislike old dingy walls with flaky paint. So a fresh paint job is often a key step in turning a house into a home. And that's been great for Sherwin-Williams (NYSE: SHW ) . It's not a sizzling growth story -- sales have grown from $5 billion in 2001 to around $7 billion in 2009. And in coming years, analysts only expect sales to keep growing at a high single-digit pace. Yet for a ""forever stock,"" that's good enough.
What drives the company's growth? A nice combination of annual price increases, new household formation of around 1.0-1.5 million in the United States (a trend which has only temporarily stalled in recent years), and international expansion. The company, which is five years away from its 150th anniversary, operates more than 3,000 stores.
Here in the United States, Sherwin-Williams should benefit from an eventual rebound in housing. Looking abroad, the company has a chance to build on its 500-plus store base, developing a go-to brand name as it has in the United States. Those growth drivers are augmented by a series of stock buybacks as management puts excesscash flow to work.Free cash flow (FCF ) is on track to rise for its sixth straight year, to nearly $700 million.
Sherwin Williams is also on track to boost itsdividend for at least the 10th straight year. (My database doesn't go back further than that). The company hiked itsdividend by more than 20% a year during 2005 through 2007, though payout hikes have been more modest in recent years. A reboundingeconomy and all thatFCF should set the stage for more robustdividend hikes in the years to come.
As a final kicker, the company's return on equity has exceeded 30% in each of the last four years -- not bad for a company that was exposed to the brutal downturn in the housing market.
Action to Take --> It's simply hard to imagine a scenario where demand for paint slumps. And Sherwin-Williams has the most powerful brand in the business. A caveat to the ""forever stocks"" scenario: markets have rebounded sharply, liftingshares of companies like Yum Brands and Sherwin-Williams. Some investors may prefer to wait for deep market pullbacks before pouncing on these buy-and-hold-forever names. Then again, that approach may cause you to miss out on even more upside that many predict for thestock market in coming years.

1793.0,2011-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,The One Sector to Buy in a Flat-Lining Market,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/one-sector-buy-flat-lining-market-2011-04-11,,,"On Friday, investors seemed more focused on the federal government's budget negotiations and on upcoming Q1 earnings than on buying or selling stocks. Q1 earnings start today, with Alcoa (NYSE: AA ) reporting after the close, and some analysts have been saying that comparisons with last year's results could be difficult. Many of the weekend financial publications concluded that these were the reasons for such a disinterest in stocks.
From a technical point of view, it is not important why stocks turned lower - only that they did. Nor is it significant why volume fell to a fraction of what it was this time last year. But it is important that momentum has fallen sharply following the December to late-February rally - and is still falling (see S&P 500 green momentum histogram). Stubborn trends like falling momentum are difficult to reverse and often lead to falling stock prices.
It is fair to say that disinterest in stocks has resulted in a daily range of trading (high/lows) that has become so narrow that as one analyst put it, ""the indices have flat-lined."" That flat-line is clearly shown on the S&P 500 at the 1,332 line. Technicians call this a ""major resistance line,"" and until that line is decisively broken, momentum will continue to fall and investors should remain cautious and defensive.
But despite the lethargy in the overall market, it is seldom that there isn't a single sector in which to invest since the causes of lethargy and even fear create opportunities in other areas. Currently the broad sectors that are advancing include commodities such as food products like cattle, pork bellies, corn, etc. And gold, silver and energy again led with vigor, especially the Canadian markets.
Despite the steep angle of advance seen with silver and other commodities, these groups continue to offer investors the best opportunity for near-term success due to their ability to offset the possible future inflationary trend referred discusses by the Fed at their recent FOMC meeting.

Southwest Airlines LUV.N canceled more than 200 flights, while Delta Air Lines DAL.N and American Airlines AAL.O canceled 148 and 98 flights, respectively, as of 8:17 a.m. ET, according to flight-tracking website Flightaware.com.
About 795 flights were also delayed.
Airports at Tampa, Clearwater and Tallahassee shut down operations and were monitoring the status of the storm.
Drawing strength from the Gulf of Mexico's warm waters, Idalia was forecast to unleash destructive winds and torrential downpours that will cause coastal flooding up to 16 feet (4.88 m) deep.
Idalia grew from a tropical storm into a hurricane early on Tuesday, a day after passing west of Cuba, where it damaged homes, knocked out power, flooded villages and prompted mass evacuations.
""With Tampa Airport closing at midnight Tuesday, we canceled everything there through at least afternoon today and we're awaiting a decision from the airport as to when it will re-open to commercial service,"" Southwest Airlines said on Wednesday.
The airline also ceased operations for the day at Jacksonville International Airport.

2775.0,2023-03-29 00:00:00 UTC,Here's Why You Should Retain Expeditors (EXPD) Stock Now,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-you-should-retain-expeditors-expd-stock-now,,,"Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. EXPD is benefiting from its solid liquidity as well as shareholder-friendly measures. However, escalating operating expenses are headwinds.
Factors Favoring EXPD
Expeditors' increasing current ratio (a measure of liquidity) is encouraging. The measure was 2.20 at 2022-end compared with 2.07 at the end of the third quarter of 2022. A current ratio of more than 1 indicates that the company's assets will be able to cover its debts that are due at the end of the year.
We are impressed by Expeditors' efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks. In the pandemic-ravaged 2020 and 2021, the company repurchased 4.6 million and 4.4 million shares at an average price of $72.26 and $117.54 per share.
In May 2022, the company had announced a 15.5% hike in semi-annual cash dividend to 67 cents per share (annualized $1.34). In 2022, EXPD repurchased 14.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of $108.88 per share and paid cash dividends of $1.34 per share.
Key Risk
Expeditors is being hurt by the increase in operating expenses. Notably, operating expenses increased more than 4% year over year in 2022, despite the company's cost-cutting initiatives to combat weak demand. High operating expenses are restricting the bottom-line growth.
Zacks Rank & Key Picks
Expeditors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation sector are American Airlines AAL and Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK).
American Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is benefiting from the improved air-travel-demand situation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, AAL reported earnings of $1.17 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.63%.
For first-quarter and full-year 2023, AAL’s earnings are expected to register 100.4% and 332% growth, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.
Alaska Air, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 at present, is seeing continued improvement in air-travel demand. On the back of upbeat air-travel demand and favorable pricing, Air Alaska Air reported better-than-expected earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. ALK expects first-quarter 2023 total revenues to increase 29-32% from the first-quarter 2022 actuals.

2088.0,2023-11-24 00:00:00 UTC,NVIDIA and Lowes Companies have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-and-lowes-companies-have-been-highlighted-as-zacks-bull-and-bear-of-the-day,,,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – November 24, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares NVIDIA NVDA as the Bull of the Day and Lowe’s Companies LOW as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Delta Air Lines DAL, American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
NVIDIA delivered the goods this week with big Q3 beats and higher views of Q4.
For Q3, NVIDIA reported non-GAAP earnings of $4.02 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 20%.
Moreover, the reported figure soared a whopping 593% year-over-year while increasing 49% sequentially. The robust increase in earnings was mainly driven by higher revenues and improvement in gross margin.
Revenues more than tripled on a year-over-year basis and climbed 34% sequentially to $18.12 billion.
The robust growth in the top line was mainly driven by record sales in the Data Center end market and recovery across the Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets due to the normalization of channel inventory.
Datacenter was +280% at $14.5B!
The top line also beat the consensus projection of $16.19 billion by 12%.
The Path to $100 Billion in Revenues
You can review my June and September projections for NVIDIA to hit $100 billion in annual revenues in this October report. Here's an excerpt...
Jensen Huang said this: ""The world has something along the lines of about a trillion dollars' worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise. And that trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI.""
I think this translates into NVIDIA hitting $100 billion per year in revenue much sooner than my 2026 projection in June. So don’t miss your chance to buy NVDA under $450 again. I’m pretty sure you won’t see it below $400 ever again.
(end of excerpt from 10/6 report)
Investors got a big gift in late October with a market dive giving you chances to buy NVDA at $400!
And if anyone thought the party was going to stop, Jensen & Co. offered revenue guidance for the current quarter that is projected to cross $20 billion, over $2B higher than estimates.
The only blemish was Jensen's warning about export restrictions on sales to China. With 20-25% of revenues coming from China, it's a real concern.
As we would expect when it comes to the big unknown of government intervention, Jensen doesn't have good visibility on that horizon.
But many analysts believe him when he says that NVIDIA has work-arounds where they can still sell technology to China.
In the bigger picture, a lot of other nations could, and probably will, make up for any loss of sales to China.
The Bigger Picture
Jensen spoke Tuesday night of the global transformation to ""AI factories."" We've been watching this trend ever since BMW hired him in 2018 to build the future of intelligent manufacturing automation with AI-driven robotics design and application.
But this is also a nod to the ""factory of data"" that must be managed for all kinds of enterprises -- including Jensen's favorite future application: biology, medicine, and the healthcare benefits for people.
On Wednesday morning, BofA Semi analyst Vivek Arya appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box to explain why he raised his PT on NVDA to a Street high of $700.
He highlighted 3 big trends for NVIDIA architectures that you've heard me talk about for some time...
1. We are in a multi-decade transformation for AI, LLMs, and GenAI. This means enterprise datacenters must be revamped aggressively over the next several years to ""accelerated"" GPU-based computing. NVIDIA is the clear leader here.
2. NVIDIA is adding richer product mixes all the time, including CPU-integrated architectures and new system/software platforms to enhance CUDA.
3. Nations want ""AI sovereignty"" and by that he means they want to build their own platforms for advanced computing to manage their data and technology. Arya says NVIDIA has ""the best turn-key solution"" to do that.
More countries are experiencing the ""big-data deluge"" and the solutions are LLMs and GenAI.
Nations Need NVIDIA
This immediately made me think of my State of Threat cybersecurity report from last month. While the ""bad actors"" will be ever present, there are many more nations looking for constructive uses of AI to enhance their economies and technology infrastructures.
I also saw Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo, who raised his PT to $675, talk about his long-term earnings outlook based on industry domination in datacenter and AI software. He sees NVIDIA investors continuing to pay 30X EPS when earnings go above $20 next year.
Even as NVIDIA is able to turn the leverage and margin trim tabs, I still focus on the growth of revenues and how they are able to command a price/sales multiple of 15X which will get us above a $1.5 trillion market cap very soon in a $20 trillion TAM (total addressable market).
This is how NVDA has ""grown into its valuation"" as it inevitably approaches $100 billion in sales next year with 60%+ topline and bottomline growth!
And we are barely talking yet about the explosive growth markets of self-driving cars and all kinds of robotics after the success of the BMW buildout.
By the way, if you haven't explored the brains behind NVDA GPU chip design, check out Cadence Design Systems as a major NVIDIA partner in AI simulation capabilities.
Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA and CDNS for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.
Bear of the Day:
Lowe’s Companies posted mixed results this week for their Q3, with the topline missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate while EPS fell in line with estimates. And both sales and earnings fell from the previous year’s quarterly readings.
Lowe’s has evolved as one of the world’s leading home improvement retailers, competing with Home Depot and offering services to homeowners, renters and commercial business customers.
The company has been smartly enhancing the experience of its pro customers by upgrading pro-focused brands and revamping pro-service business website, LowesForPros.com.
But it's looking like the hey-days of the 2021-22 real estate scramble to ""buy anything, at any price"" and fix-to-flip are now solidly in the rearview mirror with housing prices extended and interest rates prohibitive.
This is showing up in the downward estimate revisions among the majority of analysts on LOW.
Quarter in Detail
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.06 barely surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of $3.05 per share but dipped 6.4% from the third-quarter fiscal 2022 tally.
Net sales of $20,471 million decreased 12.8% year over year and came below the consensus estimate of $20,974 million. Comparable sales (comps) fell 7.4% in the quarter under review, driven by lower DIY discretionary spending, partly offset by Pro customer comps. We had projected a comps decline of 4% for the quarter under discussion.
Gross profit slipped 11.9% year over year to $6,891 million, while the gross margin increased 36 basis points (bps) to 33.7%. We had expected a gross margin expansion of 10 bps year over year. Operating income amounted to $2,696 million, up from $924 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter. Also, the operating margin expanded to 13.2% from the year-earlier quarter’s reported figure of 3.9%.
Other Financial Aspects & Developments
LOW ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,210 million, long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $35,374 million and shareholders’ deficit of $15,147 million.
Lowe’s generated cash flow from operations of $7,032 million for the nine months of fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures amounted to $1,344 million for the aforementioned period. For fiscal 2023, LOW expects a capex of up to $2 billion.
In the reported quarter, Lowe’s bought back 7.3 million shares for $1.6 billion and paid out dividends of $642 million.
In the fiscal third quarter, it introduced a store and three Lowe's Outlet stores. As of Nov 3, 2023, Lowe’s operated 1,746 home-improvement stores.
Outlook
For fiscal 2023, management revised the outlook on weaker-than-expected DIY sales. LOW now projects revenues of $86 billion versus $87-$89 million expected earlier and $97.1 billion delivered in fiscal 2022.
Comparable sales in fiscal 2023 are envisioned to be down 5% year over year versus the previous guided range of -2% to -4%. The adjusted operating margin is expected to be 13.3% compared with the earlier prediction of 13.4-13.6%.
Management anticipates EPS of $13.00 versus the earlier forecast of $13.20-$13.60 for the fiscal year versus earnings of $13.89 per share earned in fiscal 2022.

3 Airline Stocks to Keep an Eye on This Holiday Weekend
Americans are certainly expected to travel this Thanksgiving holiday span, thanks to a strong labor market and price pressures cooling from last year's record highs. Compared to last year, a greater number of Americans are likely to take to the skies for Thanksgiving.
As per the American Automobile Association (AAA), more than 55 million travelers are forecast to travel for Thanksgiving, which is an increase of 2.3% from last year. Most importantly, AAA predicted that 4.7 million travelers will be flying this holiday period, and that's 290,000 more compared to the same period last year.
This year, the number of those traveling by plane will be the highest since 2005, added AAA. Similarly, Airlines for America (A4A) predicts that almost 30 million travelers are expected to fly over the Thanksgiving traveling period (Nov 17-27), which is in itself a record high.
What's more, nearly 2.7 million Americans will be flying per day during the Thanksgiving traveling period, a 9% jump from last year. Precisely, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, or Nov 26, is expected to be the busiest day for the airports since a record-setting 3.2 million Americans will be flying on that day.
Now, with the Thanksgiving holiday span poised to be one of the most traveled periods by plane, airline stocks such as Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines could get the much-needed boost.
Thus, investors should keep a tab on these stocks at the moment. After all, these airliners have a strong network of domestic routes in the United States and are aggressively hiring people to fulfill the unparalleled travel volume.
Delta Air Lines has now begun to pay dividends to its shareholders following a coronavirus-induced hiatus. It has a dividend yield of 1.1%. In the past 5-year period, DAL has increased its dividend once, and its payout ratio presently sits at 6% of earnings. Check Delta Air Lines' dividend history here.
The company also has a heartening liquidity position. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 90.6%. DAL's projected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 10.7%. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
American Airlines has posted encouraging earnings results in its latest reporting quarter. The company's consolidated traffic has increased in recent times amid high air travel demand.
The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 378%. AAL's projected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 54.6%. The company has a Zacks Rank #3.
United Airlines' initiatives to constantly add fleets is a major tailwind at present, mostly due to the uptick in air travel demand. Its revenues for the first nine-month period of this year have already increased compared to last year.
The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 286.9%. UAL's projected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 46.5%. The company has a Zacks Rank #3.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2629.0,2023-04-28 00:00:00 UTC,Diamond sales at Botswana's Debswana drop marginally in cautious market,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/diamond-sales-at-botswanas-debswana-drop-marginally-in-cautious-market,,,"GABORONE, April 28 (Reuters) - Rough diamond sales by Debswana Diamond Co dropped slightly in the first three months of the year, data released by the Bank of Botswana showed on Friday, as the market was more cautious about the current uncertain global macroeconomic outlook.
Debswana, a joint venture between Anglo American Plc AAL.L unit De Beers and Botswana's government, sells 75% of its output to De Beers with the balance taken up by state-owned Okavango Diamond Co.
Sales of diamonds from Debswana fell 1.4% and stood at $1.077 billion in the three months to March, compared with $1.092 billion in the same period last year.
In pula terms, the rough sales however recorded a 10.1% jump to 14.005 billion pula, pointing to the effects of a stronger dollar during the period.
De Beers and Botswana are currently renegotiating their mining rights and sales agreements, with President Mokgweetsi Masisi saying his government was looking to get more rough diamonds for trading outside the De Beers system.
Debswana accounts for almost all diamonds produced in Botswana, with Lucara Diamond Corp's LUC.TO Karowe mine being the only other operating diamond mine in the country.
Botswana gets about 30% of its revenues and 70% of its foreign exchange earnings from diamonds.

4247.0,2021-08-19 00:00:00 UTC,"For the Optimist, Ashford Hospitality Stock Is a Potential Gold Mine",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/for-the-optimist-ashford-hospitality-stock-is-a-potential-gold-mine-2021-08-19,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The argument that favors investing in Ashford Hospitality Trust (NYSE:AHT) stock is fairly straightforward. The hospitality REIT that invested in upscale hotels should rebound as the economy opens. From a lofty 52-week high of $77.90, AHT stock today sits pennies below $14 a share. 
Source: Marriott
Thus, investors in AHT shares simply sit back and watch as share prices move upward from their historic lows. It’s a tricky proposition, though. The company appears to be in very bad shape and carries a significant debt load. 

The Top 7 Stocks to Buy for Under $20 in August
How did things get so bad for Ashford Hospitality Trust in the first place?
AHT Stock Among Hardest Hit 
It’s no secret that large companies with high fixed costs get slaughtered in economic downturns. The pandemic’s forced shuttering of businesses dealt a particularly harsh blow to travel operators and the lodging industry. 
Massive companies like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Carnival (NYSE:CCL) simply have little recourse in such collapse: Their large asset bases are forced to sit idle while fixed costs do not abate. Ashford Hospitality Trust was no different. The company maintains a portfolio of over 100 hotel properties. 
So, there was little it could do to stop the losses during the pandemic. 
It is very much analogous to watching a large animal bleed out as a relentless pack of predators do what they must do to survive. You want to root for the prey to escape, or at least I usually do. So, in this case, I’ll make an argument that a small investment in Ashford Hospitality Trust is warranted. 
But I should add a caveat to that statement. This is truly a bet because even the most optimistic outlook has serious issues. 
That said, let’s take a balanced look at what is happening to the company from a financial perspective. There’s some good, some bad and some really ugly.
Latest Earnings Show Bright Spots 
The good news for the company is that things are looking brighter in the second quarter of this year based on revenues. That’s probably not a big surprise given that Q2 of 2020 coincided with the first three months of the pandemic. 
During that period Ashford Hospitality Trust only managed $43.07 million in revenues, leading to a $242 million net loss. 
A year later — and this is the bright spot — the company posted $193.4 million in revenues. However, that again led to a net loss, though this time a much more modest $65.26 million. 
The other bright spot is that the company has managed to significantly reduce its loss through the first half of this year compared to last. The $344 million loss it suffered through the first six months of 2020 has been held to $170.6 million. 
That’s really as good as the news gets for investors. The reason that speculative investors should be interested relates to AHT stock pre-pandemic prices. Recall that current $14 price per share? Just prior to the pandemic they traded above $200.
So if that slight bit of good news from the increased revenues gives you reason to believe things will get better, put a chunk of change toward AHT. There’s always a chance it could retest those pre-pandemic prices in the not-too-distant future. 
The four analysts following the REIT have more modest targets, with a median 12-month price of $25.50, in a range of $46-$17.
Consider the Bad and the Ugly
The bad news relates to a recent reverse stock split. And the ugly news relates to debt. 
The company undertook a 1-for-10 reverse stock split on July 16. The company had already been on a downward slide prior, but the news likely didn’t help. Reverse stock splits generally signal distress as they serve to artificially raise prices. 
As InvestorPlace contributor David Moadel wrote ahead of that split, “They can lead to further declines in the share price, followed by more reverse stock splits — it’s an awful, vicious cycle.”
Ashford Hospitality Trust also has a significant debt load. Pages 8 and 9 of its most recent earnings report outline the debt and its maturity. This year the company only has a $78 million note due, which will total just under $92 million with amortization fees included. But in 2024 and 2025 the company has notes due of $500 million, and a whopping $2.62 billion, respectively. 
So, for investors brave enough to bet on a short term bump in price based on economic reopening, beware longer-term implications.

4221.0,2021-09-09 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines Now Sees Q3 Revenue Decline About 24% To 28% From Q3 Of FY19 - Quick Facts,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-now-sees-q3-revenue-decline-about-24-to-28-from-q3-of-fy19-quick-facts,,,"(RTTNews) - Providing an update on recent performance, American Airlines said Thursday that July 2021 financial results were better than previously estimated due primarily to strong leisure passenger traffic and improving passenger yields. The company added that it was profitable excluding net special items in July.
However, the airline experienced softness in August in close-in bookings and an increase in close-in cancellations, which it attributes to the rise in COVID-19 cases associated with the delta variant and related headlines.
The August revenues were weaker than the Company had forecasted when it provided its guidance on July 22. This weakness has continued into September and has resulted in a slowing of net bookings growth for close-in travel.
American now expects its third-quarter 2021 total revenue to decline approximately 24 to 28 percent, compared to the previous guidance for a decline approximately 20 percent. The revenue decline is compared to the third quarter of 2019.
Despite these changes, the Company continues to expect a sequential improvement in both revenue and pre-tax loss before special items from the second quarter 2021. It also expects that its reported third quarter financial results will be the best quarter as measured by revenue and pre-tax loss before special items, since the pandemic began.

2653.0,2023-04-21 00:00:00 UTC,"SQM, Albemarle shares slide on Chile lithium nationalization plan",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sqm-albemarle-shares-slide-on-chile-lithium-nationalization-plan,,,"By Alexander Villegas and Ernest Scheyder
SANTIAGO, April 21 (Reuters) - Shares in Chile's top two lithium miners, SQM SQMA.SN and Albemarle Corp ALB.N, slid on Friday after the Andean country, which has the world's largest reserves of the battery metal, unveiled a plan to nationalize the industry.
The move would see Chile, the world's second largest lithium producer, shift to a model with the state holding a controlling interest in all new lithium projects through a public company that would partner with private mining firms.
The bid for state control in Chile reflects a wider wave of lithium nationalism around Latin America, home to the so-called ""lithium triangle"", which holds the world's largest trove of the metal essential for electric vehicle batteries.
It poses a fresh challenge to electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers scrambling to secure battery materials. Mexico nationalized its lithium deposits last year, and Indonesia banned exports of nickel ore, a key battery material, in 2020.
Chile's young progressive President Gabriel Boric said late on Thursday in his announcement that the country would not cancel existing contracts, though it would try to negotiate with mining firms to voluntarily shift to a public-private model.
In early trading on Friday, Chilean firm SQM's U.S.-listed shares slid 6.2%, while Albemarle was down 2.5%. SQM's lithium contract in Chile is set to expire in 2030 and Albemarle's in 2043, giving it more insulation from the potential move.
Mining shares in London fell sharply too. Rio Tinto RIO.L dropped by as much as 5% at one point to its lowest in almost a month, and was last down 4.7%. Shares in rival Anglo American AAL.L fell 4% on the day, making the basic resources sector the worst performer in Europe.
In neighboring countries in the lithium triangle, which spans Chile, Argentina and Bolivia, governments are increasingly pushing for a greater public sector stake in mining of the metal and are seeking to develop a nascent battery sector.
Argentine state energy firm YPF has got into lithium, while Bolivia has long maintained strict control over its huge though largely untapped resources. It recently gave out a lithium tender to a Chinese consortium including battery giant CATL.
Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Bolivia's Luis Arce have touted the idea of a regional lithium ""OPEC"" to coordinate on lithium policy and benefit local economies.
""Defending Bolivian lithium is defending the homeland!"" Bolivia's Arce tweeted earlier this week.

Specifically, the nation is set to weigh in on proposed amendments to the euro zone's rescue fund, and investors are betting on the country's Freedom and Solidarity party to leave the government short of the necessary number of votes for approval. On the home front, meanwhile, traders are also anxious ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) latest meeting minutes, slated for release this afternoon, as well as Alcoa's ( AA ) unofficial start to third-quarter earnings season after the closing bell.

In earnings news, Mistras Group (MG - 19.46) said its fiscal first-quarter profit soared 103% to $3.2 million, or 11 cents per share, from $1.6 million, or 6 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue, meanwhile, increased 34% to $91.4 million. On average, analysts were expecting MG to report a profit of 10 cents per share on sales of $81.1 million.

In pre-market trading, MG is headed for a 3.6% gain.

Today's earnings docket will feature reports from Alcoa ( AA ), Joe's Jeans ( JOEZ ), Synergetics USA ( SURG ), and EXFO Inc. ( EXFO ). Keep your browser at SchaeffersResearch.com for more news as it breaks.
Economic Calendar
The central bank will take the spotlight today, with the release of the FOMC's latest meeting minutes on tap. The economic agenda is relatively light on Wednesday, with the MBA mortgage index slated for release. Meanwhile, Thursday heats up with the August trade balance, the holiday-delayed crude inventories report, and the weekly report on initial jobless claims. Friday winds down with September retail sales data, the Reuters/UMich consumer sentiment index, business inventories, and import/export prices.
Market Statistics
Equity option activity on the Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) saw 829,353 call contracts traded on Monday, compared to 519,073 put contracts. The resultant single-session put/call ratio arrived at 0.63, while the 21-day moving average was 0.72.
Overseas Trading
Asian markets ended broadly higher today, with traders taking their cues from Wall Street's big Monday rally. Banking stocks paced the advancing issues in China, after the country's sovereign wealth fund disclosed sizable share purchases in both Industrial & Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China. Meanwhile, Seoul-listed retailers were boosted by relatively tame inflation data, which could enable Bank of Korea policymakers to stand pat on rates when they meet later this week. By the close, Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 2.4%, Japan's Nikkei rose roughly 2%, South Korea's Kospi climbed 1.6%, and China's Shanghai Composite tacked on 0.2%.
On the other hand, benchmark European indexes are wallowing south of breakeven at midday. Anxiety is running high as Slovakia prepares to vote on the proposed expansion of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), as the country is the last euro-zone member to weigh in on the matter. Additionally, next week's planned meeting of European Union leaders has been postponed until Oct. 23, with President Herman Van Rompuy citing the need for more time ""to finalize our comprehensive strategy on the euro area sovereign debt crisis."" Against this uneasy backdrop, London's FTSE 100 is down 0.7%, the French CAC 40 is off 0.5%, and the German DAX has shed 0.7%.
Currencies and Commodities
The greenback is trading modestly higher this morning, with the U.S. dollar index up 0.4% at last look.

3906.0,2022-01-03 00:00:00 UTC,Why Gevo Stock Is Up Nearly 14% Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-gevo-stock-is-up-nearly-14-today,,,"What happened
Shares of biofuels producer Gevo (NASDAQ: GEVO) were up almost 14% as of 12:05 p.m. ET Monday, starting the new year off with a bang thanks to similarly strong bullish interest in companies closely associated with Gevo's flagship product.
So what
After Gevo ended 2021 on a mostly bearish foot, and at a new 52-week low, investors are changing their minds about the stock. The rally apparently stems from the fact that the company makes and markets liquid hydrocarbons using an approach that's completely carbon neutral. Its fuels can be used in a variety of ways, though its potential as a jet fuel is easily the most promising game changer.
To this end, Gevo shareholders can thank the renewed bullishness behind airline stocks for Monday's big gains. Shares of Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and American Airlines are up 3.5%, 4.6%, and 4.8%, respectively, today despite a spate of COVID-prompted flight cancellations during the busy holiday season. Investors are looking past these temporary disruptions and still seeing a bigger-picture rebound for the air travel industry. That post-pandemic rebound, however, is converging with an even bigger shift toward cleaner energy solutions.
That being said, it's also arguable that at least some of Monday's surge for Gevo can be chalked up to how primed the stock was for a bounce after losing more than 70% of its value between February's peak and 2021's closing price.
Now what
Neither bullish prompt, however, has the sort of staying power investors can count on.
That's not to suggest Gevo has no future. Indeed, low carbon biofuels are the future. While the underlying science requires more refining and the fiscal aspects of the business still don't work (Gevo remains deep in the red on minimal revenue), traditional oil drilling and refining are falling out of favor. This paradigm shift won't occur in a single day, though, particularly on the first trading day of a new year.
At the very least, would-be Gevo investors will want to observe the stock for the next several days, if only to see if Monday's bullishness is the beginning of a more prolonged trend.

1090.0,2021-01-21 00:00:00 UTC,AA March 5th Options Begin Trading,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aa-march-5th-options-begin-trading-2021-01-21,,,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options become available today, for the March 5th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new March 5th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $17.00 strike price has a current bid of 29 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $17.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $16.71 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $20.51/share today.
Because the $17.00 strike represents an approximate 17% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.71% return on the cash commitment, or 14.48% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $17.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $21.50 strike price has a current bid of 12 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $20.51/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $21.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.41% if the stock gets called away at the March 5th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $21.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $21.50 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.59% boost of extra return to the investor, or 4.97% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $20.51) to be 82%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

410.0,2023-10-13 00:00:00 UTC,Major Banks Start Reporting Q3 Earnings,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/major-banks-start-reporting-q3-earnings,,,"It’s the unofficial start to Q3 earnings season with the morning releases of some of the biggest banks on Wall Street. In truth, we’ve been seeing Q3 reports come in dribs and drabs previously this week and before. Traditionally, earnings season didn’t kick off until Alcoa (AA) reported, but they’re not scheduled until next Wednesday. In any case, we’re happy we’re here; we can finally get a good glimpse at how the past quarter went, and how the full year is expected to finish.
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated JPMorgan Chase (JPM) posted Q3 earnings of $4.33 per share, nicely surpassing the $3.89 in the Zacks consensus for an +11.3% positive earnings surprise — and its fifth-straight bottom-line beat. Revenues of $39.87 billion in the quarter outperformed expectations by +1.9%, helping solidify its leadership status of the biggest Wall Street banks.
Citigroup (C) also beat estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning for its Q3, with earnings of $1.63 per share coming in ahead of the $1.26 analysts were looking for on $20.4 billion in quarterly revenues, which surpassed the $19.32 billion anticipated. Both Institutional and Wealth Management outperformed expectations in the quarter, and shares are up +2.6% on the news.
Wells Fargo (WFC) made it a trifecta this morning, outpacing expectations on both earnings and revenues. The company reported $1.39 per share — nicely above the $1.25 Zacks consensus and the $1.30 per share posted in the previous year’s quarter. Revenues of $20.86 billion in the quarter beat estimates by a cool +3.18%. Shares are up +2.4% in pre-market trading at this hour, nearly bring shares back to break-even for the year.]
The September Import Price Index this morning came in well below expectations: +0.1% versus +0.5% consensus, which was also the previous month’s print. It’s the smallest move on import prices since June. Stripping out volatile petrol (fuel oil/gasoline), this figure drops to -0.3% — lower than the -0.1% anticipated and the lowest result since June of 2022. Year over year came in -1.7% for the eighth straight down-month. It’s worse than the -1.4% expected, but the closest to break-even since February.
Exports came in +0.7% month over month. Its -4.1% year over year is pretty much in-line with analyst expectations, and an improvement from the downwardly revised -5.7% the previous month. This is the sixth-straight month lower on export prices, year over year. After today’s open, we’ll see Consumer Sentiment for October, expected to tick down to 67.4 from 68.1 reported last month.

From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

According to reports, as a result of these travel problems, many people were stranded at airports as their flights were canceled and there was confusion over what to do next.
Airlines across the U.S and the world have been facing staff issues since many weeks with the omicron variant spreading rapidly. As the variant is known to be highly infectious, more and more people are falling sick with Covid-19.
According to reports, the average number of new U.S cases over the past week has risen more than 55 percent to 205,000 per day.
Even though Fauci recommended a vaccine mandate for domestic travel, the U.S President Joe Biden has not yet supported the plan. Biden was in favor of reducing quarantine times and the Center for Disease Control had on Monday reduced the quarantine recommendations to five-days of isolation.
Along with the Omicron variant, weather issues further disrupted the travel plans for many travelers. According to Reuters, snowy weather in the Pacific Northwest led to major disruptions, with 90 flight arrivals being canceled at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport itself.
News reports also circulated of more impending travel bans and the postponement of the Davos economic forum, which will affect business travel in general. The Davos Economic forum will most likely be moved online.
In other cases, sporting events were also canceled, with many countries bringing back strong lockdown measures.

4595.0,2021-04-02 00:00:00 UTC,U.S. CDC: Vaccinated people can resume travel at 'low risk',AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-cdc%3A-vaccinated-people-can-resume-travel-at-low-risk-2021-04-02-0,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday said fully vaccinated people can safely travel at ""low risk"", after the agency had held off for weeks on revising guidance that discouraged all non-essential trips.
The announcement lifting the agency's guidance that all Americans should avoid non-essential travel should be a shot in the arm for a U.S. travel industry still struggling since the COVID-19 crisis began in early 2020. The new CDC guidance specifically greenlights vaccinated grandparents getting on airplanes to see grandchildren.
A group representing major U.S. airlines including American Airlines, Delta Air lines DAL.N, United Airlines UAL.O Southwest Airlines LUV.N and other trade groups had urged the CDC on March 22 to immediately update its guidance to say ""vaccinated individuals can travel safely."" Air travel still remains down 43% from pre-COVID levels and business and international travel remain even harder hit.
Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said the ""new travel guidance is a major step in the right direction that is supported by the science and will take the brakes off the industry that has been hardest hit by the fallout of COVID by far.""
The new guidance also says fully vaccinated people do not need to get a COVID-19 test before or after travel and do not need to self-quarantine after travel.
""Vaccines can help us return to the things we love about life, so we encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as they have the opportunity,"" CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.
The CDC said grandparents who have been fully vaccinated can fly to visit grandkids without getting a COVID-19 test or self-quarantining as long as they follow CDC advice for traveling safely.
But the administration is not lifting restrictions that bar most-non U.S. citizens from the United States who have recently been in China, Brazil, South Africa and most of Europe. It is also keeping requirements that nearly all international U.S. air visitors getting a negative COVID-19 test before traveling to the United States.
A U.S. official briefed on the matter said the Biden administration is beginning to have conversations about how and when it might eventually lift those travel restrictions but no change is imminent. The U.S. also still maintains restrictions at the Canadian and Mexican borders that bar non-essential visitors.
The agency still ""recommends delaying travel until you are fully vaccinated, because travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19.""
In a sign of some remaining concerns about travel, Walensky said that despite the change in guidance the CDC was still not recommending fully vaccinated people travel ""at this time due to the rising number of cases"".
The CDC's new guidance says fully vaccinated people do not need COVID-19 tests before international travel unless it is required by the international destination and vaccinated people returning from foreign travel do not need to self-quarantine after returning to the United States, unless required by state or local authorities.
The CDC had repeatedly declined in recent weeks to change the guidance and repeated it was still discouraging all non-essential travel because of a concern about new variants.
Many Americans have not been heeding the CDC's advice. The Transportation Security Administration screened 1.56 million people at U.S. airports, just below Sunday's 1.57 million, which was the highest daily total since March 2020. The last time the number of airport passengers screened was below 1 million was March 10.
The Biden administration has taken steps to reduce international travel and mandated masks in nearly all forms of public transit. The administration is not eliminating any mask rules.

1305.0,2013-09-13 00:00:00 UTC,Fed in Focus as 2013 Q3 Earnings Season Gets Underway - Earnings Preview,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/fed-focus-2013-q3-earnings-season-gets-underway-earnings-preview-2013-09-13,,,"Fed in Focus as 2013 Q3 Earnings Season Gets Underway
The market's focus is justifiably on the Fed this week, given expectations that the FOMC will start 'Tapering' its bond-purchase program. Also of interest will be the FOMC members' updated economic forecasts and the Bernanke press conference where the outgoing Fed Chairman will try to explain their 'Taper' decision, or lack thereof.
Some in the market continue to hope that the Fed will hold off on the 'Taper' decision this week given the still-tepid economic picture and the potentially destabilizing upcoming budget and debt-ceiling debates in Congress. With the Syria debate now moving to the background, Congress's attention will be shifting to these divisive topics in the coming days, not to mention a potentially noisy Senate confirmation battle for Larry Summers as the next Fed Chairman, should he get the nod as many speculations seem to suggest.
Please check out the very informative post by Nick Kalivas on the evolving monetary policy picture and the issues facing the Fed. Click here .
The Fed will no doubt be the big subject this week, but we are getting close to the start of the 2013 Q3 earnings season as well. In fact, the Q3 earnings season will actually get underway this week with the earning release from Adobe Systems ( ADBE ) after the close on Tuesday, followed by reports from such bellwethers as FedEx ( FDX ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) on Wednesday.
Alcoa (AA) typically gets credited for kick-starting each earnings season, but since we count all companies with quarters ending in August as part of our Q3 tally, the Q3 earnings season will have gotten underway weeks before Alcoa reports on October 8th. It will be interesting to see how much attention the aluminum giant's earnings report will get this earnings season since it will have lost its position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In total, we have 20 companies reporting Q3 results this week, including 5 S&P 500 members.
As has been the case at the start of recent quarterly earnings cycles, expectations for the Q3 earnings season have fallen sharply over the last three months. Total earnings for companies in the S&P 500 are now expected to be up only +1.3% from the same period last year. This is down materially from what was expected at the start of the quarter in early July, as the chart below shows.
This negative revisions behavior is hardly unusual as we have been repeatedly seeing this pattern play out in recent quarters. Companies have been overwhelmingly guiding lower, prompting analysts to cut estimates for the following quarter. The revisions behavior ahead of the Q2 earnings season was no different and most of the same sectors have experienced negative revisions this time around as well. The 'regulars' on the negative estimate revisions beat include Technology, Basic Materials, and Industrials. But Retail and Consumer Discretionary have played material roles in bringing down expectations for Q3.
The chart below compares the Q3 total earnings growth expected for these five sectors at the start of the quarter and where those expectations stand at present
Estimates for other sectors have come down as well, with even the Finance sector earnings expected to be up +7% now vs. the +8.1% that was expected in early July. Energy, Utilities, Conglomerates and even Construction have suffered negative revisions in varying degrees.
While estimates for Q3 have come down, the same for Q4 and the following quarters have held up fairly well, as the chart below shows.
Part of the extremely strong growth expected in Q4 is a function of easier comparisons, as 2012 Q4 represents the lowest quarterly earnings total for the S&P 500 in the last six quarters, with the comps particularly easy for the Finance sector. But it's not all due to easy comparisons, as the expected earnings totals for Q4 represent a new all-time quarterly record. Total earnings for the S&P 500 reached a new record at $255.9 billion in Q2, surpassing Q1's $253.9 billion record. But they are expected to reach $273.6 billion in 2013 Q4, with total earnings growth outside of Finance expected at +8.5%.
Judging by what has happened over the past year or so, these Q4 estimates will come down as companies share their outlooks on the Q3 earnings calls. The market didn't care much as estimates came down in the last few quarters, hoping for better times ahead. Will it do the same this time as well, pushing its hopes of earnings ramp up into 2014? We will find out the answer to that question over the next two months.
Monday-9/16
We will get the August Industrial Production index and capacity utilization numbers in the morning. The expectation is for +0.4% increase in IP and an uptick in utilization.
We will also get the September Empire State manufacturing index, with consensus expectations of a modest improvement from August's 8.2 reading.
Tuesday -9/17
The Fed's two-day meeting gets underway today.
August CPI and September homebuilder sentiment index will be coming out in the morning. The CPI reading is expected to remain benign and the homebuilder index is expected to remain unchanged from the prior month's 59 reading. The recent spike in interest rates is a net negative for the housing sector and could show up in this reading.
The Q3 earnings season gets underway today, with earnings reports from FactSet Research ( FDS ) in the morning and Adobe Systems ( ADBE ) after the close.
Wednesday-9/18
The big news of the day is whether the FOMC meeting will result in the 'Taper' announcement or not. Economic projections of FOMC members and the Bernanke press conference will be other key events of the day. But the Fed activities will take place in the afternoon.
In the morning, we will get the August Housing Starts and Permits numbers, with expectations of gains on the Starts and a decline on the Permits fronts.
FedEx ( FDX ), General Mills ( GIS ) and Cracker Barrel ( CBRL ) will be the key Q3 earnings reports in the morning, while Oracle ( ORCL ) will report after the close.
Thursday -9/19
Jobless Claims, Existing Home sales, Philly Fed and Leading Indicators round out a busy economic docket.
ConAgra ( CAG ), Pier 1 Imports ( PIR ) and Rite Aid ( RAD ) will report results in the morning.
Friday-9/20

2372.0,2023-08-02 00:00:00 UTC,Biden admin split over ethanol's role in aviation fuel subsidy program,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biden-admin-split-over-ethanols-role-in-aviation-fuel-subsidy-program,,,"By Jarrett Renshaw, Stephanie Kelly and Leah Douglas
Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is divided over whether to grant a request from the U.S. biofuel industry that would make it easier for sustainable aviation fuel made from corn-based ethanol to qualify for subsidies under the White House's signature climate law, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.
The indecision has touched off a lobbying battle between two big stakeholders - Farm Belt backers who view sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as crucial to ethanol's growth and environmental advocates who say clearing land to grow crops for fuel is counterproductive to solving global warming.
At issue is a requirement in last year's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that SAF producers seeking tax credits must demonstrate with an approved scientific model that their fuel generates 50% less greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle than petroleum fuel.
Midwest ethanol producers have asked the administration to adopt a model that would enable ethanol-based SAF to qualify while environmentalists want standards that would favor inputs like used cooking oil and animal fat.
Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency and agriculture and energy departments are divided over which model to use, and White House Climate Czar John Podesta is seeking to resolve the question, according to the sources.
A White House official said the administration’s SAF policy seeks to include ethanol, but “we are trying to seek alignment with stakeholders on the question of modeling.”
The EPA, Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy did not respond to requests for comment.
The administration's decision will determine who benefits from billions of dollars in subsidies expected under the program. It is meant to announce a decision by September.
The administration has a goal to supply at least 3 billion gallons of SAF per year by 2030 as part of its broader effort to decarbonize the transport sector. By 2050, it hopes the SAF industry - which is now miniscule - will meet 100% of aviation fuel demand at around 35 billion gallons per year.
LAND USE
The biofuels lobby, which has found allies among commercial airlines and farm state lawmakers, is arguing that the administration cannot meet those targets if it blocks ethanol as an SAF feedstock and would hurt farmers in the meantime.
""Barring the aviation industry from embracing the most accessible SAF options will not only deprive American farmers of the chance to contribute to a new clean energy market, but also severely delay adoption of promising low-emission energy sources,"" a bipartisan group of lawmakers wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday.
Environmental groups, meanwhile, say the administration must carefully assess which fuels to allow as SAF feedstocks given the climate risks of clearing land for fuel crops.
Nikita Pavlenko, the fuels team lead at International Council on Clean Transportation, said if the administration accepts the biofuel industry's position, ""it would lead to throwing even more money away on additional corn and soy with dubious climate benefits.""
President Joe Biden, who has made tackling climate change a central pillar of his administration, has raised expectations among farmers.
""Mark my words: the next 20 years, farmers are going to be providing 95% of all the sustainable airline fuel,"" Biden told a crowd in Maine last week.
The IRA says producers must use the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization, or a ""similar methodology"", for measuring SAF's emissions.
The ethanol industry wants to use the U.S. Department of Energy's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model.
CORSIA is more likely than GREET to exclude ethanol-based SAF from the subsidy program because of the way it evaluates the emissions of so-called indirect land-use change, the displacement of existing farmland or natural vegetation to grow crops.
The administration is considering a compromise that would incorporate certain aspects of the GREET system into a new methodology, a source familiar with the matter said. However, it was unclear how that would work.

4354.0,2021-07-12 00:00:00 UTC,Why Southwest Airlines Stock Took Flight in the First Half of 2021,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-southwest-airlines-stock-took-flight-in-the-first-half-of-2021-2021-07-13,,,"What happened
The so-called ""reopening trade"" gained velocity in early 2021, and airline stocks were among the beneficiaries. Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) gained 13.9% in the first six months of the year, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, and was up as much as 36% in April before falling back some.
LUV data by YCharts
So what
Airlines were among the industries hardest hit in 2020 by the pandemic, with travel demand all but evaporating a year ago. As the vaccine rollout picked up pace so did demand, and some of the sectors that were hardest hit at the height of the pandemic posted impressive gains starting last fall and heading into this spring.
The airlines were among them. Southwest's mid-spring 36% gain for the year actually trailed a lot of other airlines including American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU), and Hawaiian Holdings (NASDAQ: HA). One thing all of those airlines have in common is they are all aggressively chasing leisure business.
Image source: Southwest Airlines.
With tourists, and not businesses, leading the way back to the airports, the airlines that have route networks and ticketing policies favored by leisure travelers have seen the recovery materialize faster than rivals who rely on corporate accounts.
The rally fizzled in recent months amid concerns about new variants, and based on suggestions from analysts that the stocks have begun to get ahead of the businesses.
Now what
It's an odd moment right now for airline investors, and in particular holders of Southwest. On one hand, the airlines are definitely off the lows from the pandemic. Southwest remains a best-in-class operator with a strong balance sheet and the wherewithal to ride out whatever potential turbulence lies up ahead. On the other hand, the company's longtime CEO Gary Kelly is preparing to step down, and the airline is having a miserable summer when it comes to staffing its flights and avoiding cancellations.
There's nothing wrong with holding Southwest for the long haul and riding out the current storms, but I'd advise caution to those considering buying in right now. Until Southwest's internal issues are behind it and we are sure the pandemic is fully under control, there is likely a ceiling on how high the airlines can fly, and after the first half rally there might not be much more room to run for now.

1545.0,2012-09-04 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa Gains Control of Evermore - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-gains-control-of-evermore-analyst-blog-2012-09-04,,,"Aluminium giant Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) has announced that it has gained full control of Evermore Recycling, effective August 31, 2012. Evermore Recycling was part of the joint venture between Alcoa and Novelis.
Evermore recycling, which is a used beverage container recycling specialist, has now become a part of Alcoa's Global Packaging group and will remain headquartered in Nashville, USA.
Alcoa sees a great prospect in recycling and believes that aluminum cans are the most easily recycled containers. The company believes that full control of Evermore Recycling will make its stake stronger in the scrap markets.
Aluminum cans take less than two months to be converted into new cans. Moreover, the energy requirement of the recycled cans is almost 95% lesser than the cans using primary metals. Aluminum has the unique ability of being recycled quite a number of times and about two thirds of the aluminum that was first produced in 1888 is still in the market.
Alcoa is a leading producer of primary and fabricated aluminum as well as the world's largest miner of bauxite and refiner of alumina. The company released its second-quarter 2012 results in July 2012. It posted a loss of $2 million (break-even on a per-share basis) in the quarter compared with a profit of $322 million (or 28 cents a share) in the year-ago quarter. The bottom line was hit by lower aluminum prices.
Excluding one-time special items (including restructuring and other charges, litigation expenses and tax-related items), Alcoa earned 6 cents a share in the quarter, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but below the year-ago earnings of 32 cents a share.
Revenues decreased 9.4% year over year to $5,963 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,828 million. Though weak aluminum prices dragged down revenues, the company witnessed increased demand across aerospace and automotive markets in the quarter. Aluminum prices dropped 18% year over year and 4% sequentially in the second quarter.
Alcoa witnessed strong performances across all its businesses during the quarter, driven by higher utilization rates, process innovations, lower scrap rates and usage reductions. The company expects higher demand for aluminum from automobile, aerospace, packaging and commercial transportation end markets in the near term.
Alcoa, which competes with Aluminum Corporation of China Limited ( ACH ) and RioTinto plc. ( RIO ), retains a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). We currently have a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock.

2182.0,2023-10-16 00:00:00 UTC,Stocks Set to Open Mixed as Investors Await Powell Speech and Corporate Earnings,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stocks-set-to-open-mixed-as-investors-await-powell-speech-and-corporate-earnings,,,"December S&P 500 futures (ESZ23) are up +0.17%, and December Nasdaq 100 E-Mini futures (NQZ23) are down -0.05% this morning as market participants braced for a busy week of corporate earnings while awaiting a key speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
In Friday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major averages closed mixed. Dollar General Corporation (DG) soared over +9% and was the top percentage gainer on the benchmark S&P 500 after the retailer announced that Todd Vasos, current Board member and former Chief Executive Officer, had been appointed CEO of the company. Also, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) gained more than +3%, and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) rose over +1% after reporting better-than-expected Q3 earnings results. In addition, energy stocks surged as the price of WTI crude rose nearly +6%, driven by indications of an imminent ground invasion of Gaza by Israel. On the bearish side, Boeing Co (BA) fell more than -3% after a news report said the planemaker and Spirit AeroSystems had expanded inspections of a production defect affecting 737 Max 8 aircraft. Also, chip stocks retreated, with ON Semiconductor (ON) dropping over -4% and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) slumping more than -3%.
Economic data on Friday showed that the University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of consumer sentiment came in at 63.0 in October, weaker than expectations of 67.2. Also, the University of Michigan’s October year-ahead inflation expectations unexpectedly rose to +3.8%, stronger than expectations of +3.2%. At the same time, the U.S. import price index stood at +0.1% m/m in September versus the consensus number of +0.5% m/m.
Meanwhile, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Friday that disinflation is underway and reiterated his preference for keeping interest rates unchanged unless there is a substantial shift in the data. “Absent a stark turn in what I see in the data and hear from contacts ... I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they are,” Harker said.
U.S. rate futures have priced in a 9.8% probability of a 25 basis point rate increase at the November FOMC meeting and a 30.4% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike at the Fed’s monetary policy committee meeting in December.
Earnings season picks up steam this week, with results expected from several more big banks, including Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), and Morgan Stanley (MS). Also, major global companies, including Tesla (TSLA), Netflix (NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL), AT&T (T), and Lockheed Martin (LMT), are expected to post quarterly updates this week.
Investors will also be monitoring a spate of economic data this week, including U.S. Retail Sales, Core Retail Sales, Industrial Production, Manufacturing Production, Business Inventories, Building Permits (preliminary), Housing Starts, Crude Oil Inventories, Initial Jobless Claims, Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index, and Existing Home Sales.
In addition, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak at the Economic Club of New York on Thursday. Market participants will be closely watching whether the strong jobs and CPI data for September prompt Powell to deliver hawkish remarks in alignment with the widespread anticipation of higher rates for longer.
Today, all eyes are focused on the U.S. NY Empire State manufacturing index in a couple of hours. Economists, on average, forecast that the October NY Empire State manufacturing index will come in at -7.00, compared to the previous value of +1.90.
Also, investors will likely focus on a speech from Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker.
In the bond markets, United States 10-year rates are at 4.681%, up +1.15%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 futures are down -0.12% this morning as investors weighed prospects of an escalation in the Middle East conflict while gearing up for the start of earnings season. Utilities and tech stocks underperformed on Monday, while mining and energy stocks gained ground. Meanwhile, Polish stocks experienced their most significant surge since May 2022, and the Polish zloty strengthened as the country’s opposition party appeared to be on track for a majority following Sunday’s election. In corporate news, Ssab Ab (SSABB.S.DX) rose over +2% after JP Morgan upgraded the Swedish steel company to Overweight from Neutral.
Germany’s WPI and Italy’s CPI data were released today.
The German September WPI stood at +0.2% m/m, weaker than expectations of +0.3% m/m. 
The Italian September CPI has been reported at +0.2% m/m and +5.3% y/y, in line with expectations.
Asian stock markets today settled in the red. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -0.46%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -2.03%.
China’s Shanghai Composite today closed lower even after the country’s central bank made the biggest medium-term liquidity injection since 2020. The People’s Bank of China injected 789 billion yuan worth of liquidity into the banking system via its one-year medium-term lending facility Monday while keeping the policy rate unchanged at 2.5%. Separately, to improve market sentiment, China’s securities regulator announced on Saturday that it would impose limitations on securities lending activities and tighten scrutiny of improper regulatory arbitrage. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that the United States would tighten sweeping measures that limit China’s access to advanced semiconductors and chip manufacturing equipment. In other news, foreign investors sold a net total of 6.5 billion yuan worth of Chinese stocks through the Stock Connect program on Monday. Investor focus is now squarely on Chinese growth data for the third quarter, due later in the week.
“The PBOC continues to show an easing bias in today’s operation. We hold our view that China rates remain a lower-for-longer story on the back of likely continued subpar growth during the current period of economic transition,” said Becky Liu, head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Bank. 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed sharply lower today, mirroring the decline seen in the S&P 500 on Friday as concerns over the Israel-Hamas war continued to weigh on sentiment. Heavyweight chip stocks retreated on Monday, tracking U.S. technology stocks, with Tokyo Electron Ltd plunging over -3% and Advantest Corp slumping more than -4%. Investors also adopted a cautious stance regarding Japan as they awaited the release of crucial inflation data for September later this week. On the positive side, Ryohin Keikaku climbed over +8% after the operator of retail outlet brand Muji provided a better-than-expected full-year profit forecast. Also, Lawson Inc. rose more than +2% after boosting its full-year profit guidance on strong performance at its convenience stores. The Nikkei Volatility, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +4.43% to 21.90.
“As risks for the Middle East rose, investors braced for further declines in markets and cut their long positions in stocks,” said Takehiko Masuzawa, head of trading at Phillip Securities Japan.

1842.0,2010-10-01 00:00:00 UTC,6 Sinking Stocks a Bull Market Won’t Save,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/6-sinking-stocks-bull-market-wont-save-2010-10-01,,,"Trade These Stocks in for Some Winners
It looks like the bull may be back! On Oct. 5, the major indices broke through resistance that has held back buyers for more than five months. This puts the market back on the offensive, and investors should be, too.
But some stocks either did not participate in the September advance or are so overpriced that profits should be taken. Here are six stocks to sell and either hold the cash or invest in a good quality stock that will participate in a general market advance.
Stock to Sell #1: Akamai Technologies (AKAM) Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM ) is a developer of solutions designed to accelerate and improve the delivery of Internet content.The stock has more than doubled in one year and jumped 43% in the past seven weeks. With a price/earnings ratio of 59 times 2010 earnings, and the stock selling at more than 35% above its 200-day moving average , it appears time to cash in this high performer and nail down a profit.
Technically AKAM is in a powerful bull market, but a small top is forming and a close under $50 could result in a quick drop to $40 to $45. S&P rates AKAM a ""two-star sell.""
See Key
Stock to Sell #2: Alcoa (AA) Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA ) is still in a bear market. Ford Research downgraded the stock on Sept. 24 to a ""sell"" based on a ""very negative"" earnings trend over the past five years. Technically the recent rally failed to reach the stock's 200-day moving average, and the stochastic is overvalued. Alcoa has regularly underperformed the market and its competition. Sell AA at market.
See Key
Stock to Sell #3: McKesson Corp. (MCK) McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK ) offers medicines, pharmaceutical supplies, and information and care management products and services for the health care industry.The stock has not kept pace with the market and is still in a downtrend. Its relative strength is bearish, there are sellers on balance, and the stochastic recently flashed a sell signal. Sell MCK at market. See Key
Stock to Sell #4: Monsanto Co. (MON) The major agricultural chemical firm Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON ) double-topped in July 2009 and January 2010. It then executed a ""death cross"" in March, and has been in a bear market since that time. Following a two-month rally, our proprietary indicator, the Collins-Bollinger Reversal (CBR), flashed a sell at over $60 in July, and the stock promptly fell 10 points. Recent heavy selling and poor earnings continue to put pressure on the stock. Sell MON at market.
See Key
Stock to Sell #5: Panera Bread Co. (PNRA) Panera Bread Company (NASDAQ: PNRA ) is the franchiser of 1,400 bakery-cafes. The stock has been a super performer; however, at 25 times 2010 earnings it is overvalued compared to its peer group, according to Standard and Poor's. S&P rates PNRA a ""two-star sell."" Technically the stock appears to have double-topped and recently flashed a sell signal from our internal indicator, the CBR, as well as from the stochastic. Sell PNRA at market. See Key
Stock to Sell #6: Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) Leading coffee retailer Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) has done well by shareholders, doubling in price in one year. However, with the price of coffee dramatically increasing and close to a 13-year high, earnings are under pressure, according to S&P, which now rates the stock a ""two-star sell.""Technically SBUX has broken its bullish support line, received a sell from the stochastic, and is close to issuing a ""death cross."" It is time for holders of Starbucks to cash in their profits.

2254.0,2023-09-17 00:00:00 UTC,Will RTX Corp Stock Recover To Its Pre-Inflation Shock Highs of $100?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-rtx-corp-stock-recover-to-its-pre-inflation-shock-highs-of-%24100,,,"RTX Corp stock (NYSE: RTX), formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, currently trades at $76 per share, about 20% lower than the level seen in early June 2022, just before the Fed started increasing rates, compared to 18% gains for the S&P 500 during this period. This underperformance of RTX stock can primarily be attributed to its recall of over 1,000 Pratt & Whitney engines and associated costs. Also, investors still have concerns about a potential recession despite a steady decline in the inflation rate in response to the Fed’s aggressive rate hike plan.
Interestingly, RTX stock has had a Sharpe Ratio of 0.2 since early 2017, much lower than 0.6 for the S&P 500 Index over the same period. This compares with the Sharpe of 1.3 for the Trefis Reinforced Value portfolio. Sharpe is a measure of return per unit of risk, and high-performance portfolios can provide the best of both worlds.
Returning to the pre-inflation shock level of about $104 means that RTX stock will have to gain over 35% from here, and we don’t think this will materialize anytime soon. RTX stock is currently trading at 1.6x revenues, compared to the last three-year average of 2.2x. Our RTX Corp Valuation Ratios Comparison dashboard has more details. Although RTX stock is trading at a valuation multiple lower than its historical average, the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines is going to cost billions to the company and it may continue to weigh on its stock in the near term.
Our detailed analysis of RTX Corp’s upside post-inflation shock captures trends in the company’s stock during the turbulent market conditions seen over 2022. It compares these trends to the stock’s performance during the 2008 recession.
2022 Inflation Shock
Timeline of Inflation Shock So Far:
2020 – early 2021: Increase in money supply to cushion the impact of lockdowns led to high demand for goods; producers unable to match up.
Early 2021: Shipping snarls and worker shortages from the coronavirus pandemic continue to hurt supply.
April 2021: Inflation rates cross 4% and increase rapidly.
Early 2022: Energy and food prices spike due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Fed begins its rate hike process.
June 2022: Inflation levels peak at 9% – the highest level in 40 years. The S&P 500 index declined more than 20% from peak levels.
July – September 2022: Fed hikes interest rates aggressively – resulting in an initial recovery in the S&P 500 followed by another sharp decline.
Since October 2022: Fed continues rate hike process; improving market sentiments help S&P500 recoup some of its losses.
In contrast, here’s how RTX stock and the broader market performed during the 2007/2008 crisis.
Timeline of 2007-08 Crisis
10/1/2007: Approximate pre-crisis peak in S&P 500 index.
9/1/2008 – 10/1/2008: Accelerated market decline corresponding to Lehman bankruptcy filing (9/15/08).
3/1/2009: Approximate bottoming out of S&P 500 index.
12/31/2009: Initial recovery to levels before accelerated decline (around 9/1/2008).
EW and S&P 500 Performance During 2007-08 Crisis.
RTX And S&P500 Performance During 2007-08 Financial Crisis
RTX stock saw a 15% decline from $48 in September 2007 (pre-crisis peak for RTX) to $41 in March 2009 (as the markets bottomed out). It declined further post the 2008 crisis to levels of around $32 in early 2010, fallng about 21% between March 2009 and January 2010. The S&P 500 Index saw a decline of 51%, falling from levels of 1,540 in September 2007 to 757 in March 2009. It then rallied 48% between March 2009 and January 2010 to reach levels of 1,124.
RTX Fundamentals Over Recent Years
RTX Corp’s revenue rose from $45.3 billion in 2019 to $67.1 billion in 2022. Raytheon’s commercial airplane business was hit during the pandemic weighing on its commercial OEM and aftermarket sales. This trend has now reversed, with both Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace Systems segments driving the sales growth for the company in the recent past. The company’s operating margin declined from 12.7% in 2019 to 10.9% in 2022. Our RTX Corp Operating Income Comparison dashboard has more details.
Does RTX Have A Sufficient Cash Cushion To Meet Its Obligations Through The Ongoing Inflation Shock?
RTX’s total debt decreased from $43 billion in 2019 to $32 billion in 2022, while its cash increased from around $5 billion to $6 billion. The company also garnered $7 billion in cash flows from operations in 2022. Although the company has a high level of debt, given its cash cushion, RTX appears to be in a comfortable position to service its near-term debt obligations.
Conclusion
With the Fed’s efforts to tame runaway inflation rates helping market sentiment, we believe RTX stock has the potential for gains once fears of a potential recession are allayed. That said, the extent of its engine recall and high debt levels remain risk factors for realizing these gains. The company will take up to a $3.5 billion charge from the recall of engines in the next few years, while the overall cost could be even higher.
While RTX stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how RTX Corp’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

It would be great to see a steady stream of good news from corporate America, but we will be taking a deeper look to see if the news is indeed as good as analysts will be gushing about. Share buyback announcements tend to coincide with earnings reports at times, but we would of course prefer to see companies lift dividend payouts, rather than using excess cash to buy back shares, including options that are issued to higher-level executives. Certainly not as rewarding to investors as most share buyback prophets would have you believe.
Taking a look at today's tape, financials pushed out in front on the back of a big upgrade call from brokerage firm Susquehanna. Names moving up on call included JP Morgan ( JPM ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS ) , and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) . Other names in the space that joined the rally included PNC Financial ( PNC ) and Blackrock ( BLK ) . The positive sentiment comes despite Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke once again trying to step up pressure on banks to begin lending more to smaller firms, which employ at least half of American workers. The jobs situation is something we will not ignore, and we see this becoming a bigger part of the earnings picture if consumer spending continues to contract (which it likely will). On a volume note, we did see a nice pick up on the NASDAQ with 4.64 Billion shares traded, while the NYSE came in at a somewhat respectable, but still somewhat light total of 4.64 Billion shares.

3862.0,2022-01-18 00:00:00 UTC,Will The Tide Turn For JetBlue Airways Stock?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-the-tide-turn-for-jetblue-airways-stock,,,"The shares of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) are trading 30% below pre-Covid levels despite relatively high passenger numbers at TSA checkpoints due to the anticipation of a prolonged dip in air travel demand. However, investors have been optimistic on Atlas Air stock (NASDAQ: AAWW), a global provider of leased aircraft and aviation operating services. Last year, Atlas Air stock surged 60% assisted by a strong air freight market where demand exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Atlas Air provides air cargo services whereas JetBlue serves passenger demand. While both companies cater to different customer groups, domestic cargo & passenger demand are key macroeconomic factors driving their top line. Does the optimism in Atlas Air stock indicate an upcoming surge in the air travel market? We compare the historical trends in revenues, margins, and valuation multiple of both companies in an interactive dashboard analysis, JetBlue Airways vs. Atlas Air – parts of which are highlighted below.
1. Revenue Growth
Atlas Air’s growth was higher than JetBlue’s before the pandemic, with Atlas Air’s revenues expanding by 14% p.a. from $1.8 billion in 2016 to $3.2 billion in 2019. JetBlue’s revenues grew by at an average rate of 7% p.a. from $6.6 billion in 2016 to $8.1 billion in 2019. JetBlue Airways reported a 60% top-line contraction in 2020 whereas Atlas Air observed a 17% growth.
Atlas Air segregates its operations into three segments, ACMI & CMI, Charter, and Dry Leasing. The ACMI segment provides cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions including aircraft, crew, and maintenance, while customers take care of fuel, landing, navigation, and other costs. The CMI segment is similar to ACMI except that the aircraft is not provided by Atlas. The Charter segment provides a complete package where the customer pays a fixed fee that includes fuel, insurance, landing, navigation, etc.
The company’s ACMI, Charter, Dry Leasing, and Other segments contribute 37%, 57%, 5%, and 1% of total operating revenues, respectively. In the last few years, Atlas Air’s growth has been majorly driven by the Charter segment, which has more than doubled since 2016.
JetBlue Airways primarily earns its revenues from the sale of air tickets and other ancillary services such as freight & mail. In the past few years, continued capacity growth along with rising ticket prices have been key contributors assisting topline expansion.
JetBlue’s domestic business contributes a bulk of the revenues and has been the major factor strengthening investor confidence in recent months. (related: Optimism In Estee Lauder Stock A Trigger For Delta Air Lines?)
2. Returns (Profits)
Coming to profitability, both companies have been reporting comparable net margin and operating cash margin in the past few years.
In 2018, Atlas Air reported net income margin and operating cash margin of 10% and 16%, respectively. The company generated $425 million of operating cash on operating revenue of $2.6 billion. Subsequently, invested $713 million in property, plant & equipment and raised $216 million in long-term debt.
Whereas, JetBlue Airways reported net income margin and operating cash margin of 2% and 16%, respectively. The company generated $1.2 billion of operating cash on revenues of $7.6 billion. Subsequently, invested $908 million in property, plant & equipment and returned $382 million to investors in share repurchases.
Both companies have been following an almost similar capital investment plan by re-investing a sizable portion of operating cash into the business.
Despite having a different target customer profile, B2C for JetBlue Airways and B2B for Atlas Air, the ratio of fixed assets (property, plant & equipment and operating leases) to total assets is comparable at 66%.
3. Risk
Atlas Air and JetBlue are similar from the perspective of financial leverage.
Financial leverage coupled with strong topline growth is a boon for investors. However, high interest expenses weigh on the bottom line if growth stalls.
In 2020, Atlas Air and JetBlue reported $2.3 billion and $4.4 billion of long-term debt, respectively. With $3 billion of cash & short-term investments, JetBlue has $1.4 billion of net debt.
Similarly, the $845 million of cash & short-term investments on Atlas Air’s balance sheet results in $1 billion of net debt. (related: Air Travel Demand To Push Boeing Stock Higher?)

2114.0,2023-11-07 00:00:00 UTC,1 Stock Set to Fly on the Airline Supply Chain Crisis,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-stock-set-to-fly-on-the-airline-supply-chain-crisis,,,"There is little doubt that airlines all over the world struggled to cope when demand roared back after the pandemic. A shortage of new planes, caused by supply chain issues, led to airlines spending more on maintenance and repairs than ever before, as they were forced to keep their existing aircraft in the air for longer.
But the airlines’ problems have been a boon for the $110 billion industry that keeps the world’s aircraft in the skies. Let me explain…
Demand Soars for Airplane Maintenance
Historically, maintenance spending has accounted for 8% to 10% of an airline’s cost to keep flying. However, this year, the aerospace consultancy Aerodynamic Advisory estimates that the world’s airlines would spend more than $110 billion on maintenance, including labor and material, or about 14% of airlines’ total revenues. That was the highest percentage Aerodynamic Advisory had ever recorded.
And according to a recent research note from Jefferies, three of the major U.S. airlines - American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and United Airlines (UAL) - spent a whopping $2.2 billion on maintenance in the third quarter, a 45% increase from the same period in 2019, before the pandemic. Trailing 12-month spend by these airlines was tracking 38% above 2019 levels.
The head of the Aerodynamic Advisory, Kevin Michaels, pointed out three contributing factors behind these soaring costs to the Financial Times.
First, airlines are investing in discretionary maintenance that had been deferred during the pandemic. Second, older aircraft - due for retirement currently - have to fly longer than expected, given the issues with new generations of engines, as well as supply chain constraints. Finally, general inflationary pressures, coupled with a lack of skilled labor, has pushed up the cost of labor and parts.
Michaels said, “this is the first time we’ve had a supply chain crisis that is really impacting the whole after-market in maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO). It’s new territory.”
In addition, airlines historically have resisted buying spare parts from anyone but the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). But that is changing rapidly.
All of this is music to the ears of the companies in the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) industry. Let’s take a closer look at one of them.
Heico: A Never-Seen-Before Environment
One such company is Heico (HEI). It is the largest independent producer and supplier of replacement parts for aircraft, and also produces niche subcomponents for defense products.
Its products and components are similar to those produced by the original equipment manufacturers, like General Electric (GE). In effect, Heico offers generic airplane parts that are sold about 30% to 40% below what the OEMs charge.
After its latest earnings report in late August, Chairman and CEO Laurans Mendelson said, “We are very pleased to report record quarterly consolidated net sales at both the Flight Support Group and the Electronic Technologies Group. These results reflect 12% consolidated organic growth in our net sales principally arising from a continued strong demand for our commercial aerospace products and services.”
The company reported record sales of $722.9 million in the third quarter ended July 31, while operating income jumped 16% to $149.4 million. About 75% of the year-over-year improvement in operating income before corporate expenses was via the Flight Support Group segment, and Heico is expanding this area with the acquisition of Wencor Group.
In early August, Heico completed the acquisition of Wencor Group from affiliates of Warburg Pincus and Wencor's management for $1.9 billion in cash and $150 million in Heico Class A common stock. The transaction was Heico's largest ever, with Wencor being about a quarter of Heico’s size.
Wencor is a large commercial and military aircraft aftermarket company offering factory-new, FAA-approved aircraft replacement parts, value-added distribution of high-use commercial & military aftermarket parts, and aircraft & engine accessory component repair and overhaul services. Its parts and repairs are found in hydraulic, pneumatic, electronic and electro-mechanical, cockpit and galley systems throughout numerous aircraft models.
Heico’s Future Glide Path 
So, what comes next for Heico?
I expect conditions in the airplane maintenance market to remain tight for quite some time, thanks to a lack of skilled workers and the limited availability of parts. The supply chain problems will still be with us for another two to three years at the least, while demand from airlines globally will not go down.
Looking specifically at Heico, it independently develops replacement parts for highly complex aircraft components — the juiciest market segment in aerospace, with a fraction of the required research and development that OEMs spend.
And Heico's components for defense products are highly integrated into complex systems, which makes their replacement or substitution difficult and unlikely.
Add it all up, and this sets up almost perfect “flying” conditions for Heico. Buy it in the $155 to $168 range.

Passenger revenues were hurt due to air traffic control issues in the Northeast.  The metric fell short of our projection of $2,250.3 million. Other revenues rose 3.1% to $152 million.  
Other Q3 Details
All comparisons are presented on a year-over-year basis, unless mentioned otherwise.
Revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenues) declined 14.2% to 13.55 cents. Passenger revenue per available seat mile plunged 14.9% to 12.68 cents. Average fare at JetBlue decreased 12.3% to $201.73. Yield per passenger mile dipped 13.9% to 14.89 cents, which fell short of our estimate of 15.76 cents.
Consolidated traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) improved 5.8%. To cater to this increased demand, capacity (measured in available seat miles) rose 7.1% to 17,362 million. Consolidated load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) contracted 100 basis points to 85.1% as traffic growth was outpaced by capacity expansion. The actual value outperformed our projection of 83.4%.
Total operating costs (on a reported basis) increased 3.5% to $2,509 million, mainly due to a 17% gain in expenses on salaries, wages and benefits. Average fuel price per gallon (including related taxes) was $2.94, up 11.8% sequentially, highlighting a rise in oil price. JBLU’s operating expenses per available seat mile (CASM) fell 3.3% year over year. Excluding fuel, CASM improved 5.9% to 10.27 cents.
JetBlue, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $973 million compared with $1,042 million at the end of 2022. Total debt at the end of the September quarter was $4,001 million compared with $3,647 million at 2022 end. So far this year, JBLU has paid off $254 million of debt and finance lease obligations.

Bleak Outlook
While providing guidance for fourth-quarter 2023, management stated that all comparisons are made with respect to fourth-quarter 2022 figures.
Capacity is anticipated to jump in the 0.5-3.5% band. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to climb 8.5-10.5%. Capital expenditures are expected to be roughly $400 million.
Total revenues are forecast to tumble in the range of 6.5-10.5%. Average fuel cost per gallon is estimated to be between $3.05 and $3.20. Interest expense is predicted in the $60-$70 million band.
Management expects loss per share in the band of 35-55 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 27 cents.  
For full-year 2023, capacity is envisioned to grow in the band of 5-7% from 2022 actuals. CASM, excluding fuel and special items, is predicted to rise 4.5-5.5% from 2022 figures. Current-year interest expense is forecast in the $205-$215 million band.
Total revenues for 2023 are anticipated to register year-over-year increase of 3-5%. Capital expenditures are expected to be roughly $1.2 billion in the current year. Share count for the current year is suggested to be 333 million.
Management now projects to incur a loss per share in the range of 45-65 cents (earlier guidance was for earnings in the 5-40 cents band) in 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at a loss of 26 cents.

4669.0,2021-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,Why Airline Stocks Are Up Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-airline-stocks-are-up-today-2021-03-01,,,"What happened
Airline shares gained altitude on Monday thanks to a series of positive signs concerning the industry's post-pandemic recovery. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) led the way higher, each up more than 5% at one point on Monday.
So what
It's been a difficult last 12 months for airlines, as the pandemic caused demand for travel to dry up and sent the entire industry into the red. We've seen a slow recovery in the shares in recent months thanks to the development of vaccines and signs there is pent-up demand for travel once it is safe. And on Monday we got a fresh batch of good news to send the stocks higher.
Image source: Getty Images.
A vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson got the green light from U.S. regulators over the weekend, which means the country now has three vaccines to deploy against the virus. A $1.9 trillion stimulus bill also passed the U.S. House of Representatives over the weekend, bringing it one step closer to becoming law. The bill contains additional funds to support airline payrolls, and should help make sure the economy is strong as the population starts making travel plans for the summer.
United did its part to get investors excited, adding to its Boeing 737 MAX order and pushing forward some deliveries in anticipation of an expected rebound in demand.
Spirit is likely coming along for the ride because the airline, with its industry-low costs and focus on leisure travelers, is expected to be among the first to fully bounce back post-pandemic. American, meanwhile, got a price-target boost to $20 from $14 from Stifel.
Now what
With each passing day, investors are growing more confident the worst is over for the airlines. They're right, but they need to be careful not to get ahead of themselves.
There is still some risk to the summer travel season, and even if vacationers do return in the months to come, it is likely going to be years before more-lucrative parts of the aviation market, including business and international flying, recover.
And while most of the airline stocks still trade at a discount to where they were pre-pandemic, if you factor in the amount of debt the industry has taken on to survive the crisis, the valuations are beginning to look frothy. Looking at the industry in terms of enterprise value (a measure of total market capitalization plus debt), some are actually up from the beginning of 2020.
Airline stocks are still attractive for those with a long time horizon, but they are no longer the bargains they were just a few months ago.

1361.0,2013-07-08 00:00:00 UTC,Will Earnings Growth Bottom in Q2? - Earnings Outlook,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-earnings-growth-bottom-q2-earnings-outlook-2013-07-08,,,"The June jobs report has put the spotlight back on the Fed and what it will do to the QE program in the coming months. But hopefully the Q2 earnings season will provide enough of a distraction to not let the Fed become a full-time fixation for the market.
Given how low expectations have come down over the last few months, the Q2 reporting season may not carry many surprises. In fact, it may be reasonable to expect this earnings season to be no different from what we have become accustomed to seeing over the last few quarters. But two aspects of this coming earnings season need paying special attention to - revenues and guidance.
Management teams are typically very good at under-promising and over-delivering. That's why roughly two-thirds of the companies end up beating earnings expectations. But an unusually big proportion of the companies came short of revenue expectations in the previous quarter. The situation has not been much different from the 23 S&P 500 companies that have reported results already, which includes companies like Oracle ( ORCL ), FedEx ( FDX ), Walgreen ( WAG ) and others. As such, more than earnings surprises, it will be interesting to keep an eye on revenue surprises.
But even more significant than growth rates and surprises will be guidance. Guidance is always important, but it has assumed even more significance this time around given the elevated expectations for the second half of the year, as the chart below shows.
Source: Zacks Data
We may not see much earnings growth in the first half of 2013, but consensus expectations are for a material growth ramp up in the back half of the year - from +2.7% in the first half to +9.2% in the second half.
Importantly, the growth expectations for the second half of the year are not due to easy comparisons - the level of total earnings expected in 2013 Q3 and Q4 represent new all-time high quarterly records, as shown by the chart below of total bottom-up consensus earnings estimates.
Source: Zacks Data
My sense is that estimates need to come down in a big way. The market hasn't cared much in the recent past about negative revisions as aggregate earnings estimates have been coming down for over a year now. But if we are entering a post-QE world, as I believe we are, then it will likely be difficult to overlook negative earnings estimate revisions going forward. How the market responds to negative guidance over and the resulting negative revisions will tell us a lot about what to expect going forward.
Key Points
Total earnings for the 23 S&P 500 companies that have reported results already are up +8.1%, with 60.9% of this small sample beating earnings expectations. Revenues for these companies are up +5.3%, with a revenue 'beat ratio' of 43.5%.
Overall expectations remain low, with total earnings for the S&P companies as a whole expected to be up +0.4% from the same period last year, reflecting -0.8% lower revenues and modestly higher margins. This follows +2.6% earnings growth in Q1 on -1.3% lower revenues.
Estimates for Q2 have come down materially since the quarter got underway, with the current +0.4% growth down from +3.9% in early April.
Finance is the only major sector with a strong growth profile, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +18.6% in Q2. This follows +7.6% earnings growth in Q1 and many quarters of double-digit gains for the sector. Excluding Finance, total earnings would be down -3.2% in Q2.
Finance reclaims its leadership role in the S&P 500, contributing more earnings to the index's total than Technology this year for the first time since the 2008 crisis. The sector is expected to account for 19.2% of total S&P 500 earnings in 2013 compared to Technology's 18%.
Technology earnings were weak in Q1 and they are even weaker this time around, with total earnings for the sector expected to decline -8.3% in Q2 after declining -4.2% in Q1. Weakness in hardware and semi-conductor industries more than offset the modest growth in software earnings. Excluding Technology, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +2.4% in Q2.
Estimate revisions remain in neutral territory at present, though Finance continues to experience strong positive revisions, while revisions for Basic Materials, Industrials, Staples, and Business Services predominantly to the downside.
Estimates for the second half of the year still reflect strong growth, with total earnings in the second half expected to increase by +9.2% after the +2.7% increase in the first half. Total earnings are expected to be up 6.4% in 2013 and +11.5% in 2014.
While there is not much growth, the overall level of total earnings is quite high. Total earnings were an all-time record at $252.6 billion in Q1 and are expected to total $250.3 billion in Q2. For the full year, earnings are expected total $1.03 trillion in 2013 and $1.15 trillion in 2014.
Net margins are expected to be up 20 basis points in Q2 as a whole and stay flat outside of the Finance sector. But expectations are for net margins to start expanding materially from the third quarter onwards. For the full year 2013, net margins are expected to top the 2006 peak and expand even further in 2014.
The bottom-up 'EPS' for the S&P 500 for 2013 and 2014 currently stands at $109.18 and $121.72, respectively. The top-down 'EPS' estimates for 2013 and 2014 currently stand at $107.83 and $114.80. (Note: All the data in this report is based on bottom-up estimates).

The initiative aims to boost development of technologies to achieve the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Its catalyst program aims to raise money from governments, philanthropists and companies to make capital investments to bring down the cost of clean technology.
Bank of America Corp BAC.N, steelmaker ArcelorMittal SAMT.LU, Boston Consulting Group BAC.N and the philanthropic arm of asset manager BlackRock Inc BLK.N have also joined the program, Breakthrough Energy said on Monday.
American Airlines said in a statement it has invested $100 million. The program will initially focus on four key areas: direct air capture, green hydrogen, long-duration energy storage and sustainable aviation fuel.
The support from U.S. companies comes against the backdrop of President Joe Biden's plans to accelerate carbon cutting. Earlier this month, the White House said it was targeting 20% lower aviation emissions by 2030.

1178.0,2014-03-31 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa to Cut Capacity in Brazil - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-to-cut-capacity-in-brazil-analyst-blog-2014-03-31,,,"Aluminum giant, Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) announced that it will cut 147,000 metric tons of smelting capacity at its Sao Luis (Alumar) and Pocos de Caldas smelters in Brazil. The company is cutting capacity to address the challenging market conditions as well as increasing costs that made the smelters uncompetitive.
At the Poços smelter, Alcoa will curtail 62,000 metric tons of capacity and 85,000 metric tons will be curtailed at Sao Luis. The curtailments are expected to be complete by the end of May 2014.
As a result of the cutbacks, the three potlines of the Pocos smelter will be fully curtailed and the Pocos refinery will also reduce production. However, the mine, aluminum powder plant and casthouse at Poços will carry on with their normal operations. The refinery at Sao Luis will also continue with the normal operations.
The company expects to incur restructuring charges in the range of $40 million and $50 million after-tax, or 4 cents to 5 cents per share in the first quarter related to the curtailments in Brazil. 30% of the expense incurred will be non cash.
In May 2013, Alcoa announced that it will review 460,000 metric tons of smelting capacity over the next 15 months for potential curtailment. Once the company completes all the curtailments and closures, it will have about 80,000 metric tons or 21% of smelting capacity offline.
Earlier in Feb 2014, Alcoa announced that it will permanently shut down its Point Henry aluminum smelter and two rolling mills in Australia by the end of 2014. Alcoa had put the Point Henry smelter under strategic review since 2012 due to the challenging market conditions and found that the smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable.
Alcoa remains on track to move down the cost curve and curtailed capacities in its upstream business. The curtailments will improve the competitiveness of the company's Primary Products business.
Alcoa, a prominent player in the mining industry along with Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd. ( ACH ) , Atlatsa Resources Corp. ( ATL ) and B HP Billiton Ltd. ( BHP ), is a world leader in production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina. The company currently retains a short-term Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

4506.0,2021-04-25 00:00:00 UTC,JetBlue and American Airlines Add Routes as Alliance Faces Antitrust Scrutiny,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jetblue-and-american-airlines-add-routes-as-alliance-faces-antitrust-scrutiny-2021-04-25,,,"Last July, American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) announced a wide-ranging partnership designed to improve their competitive positions in New York and Boston.
Over the past few months, the airlines have started to implement the first phase of this alliance. They have launched a codeshare agreement, begun ticket sales for dozens of new routes, and optimized their schedules on additional routes out of New York and Boston.
Last week, American and JetBlue rolled out the next phase of their alliance, again announcing dozens of new routes. With antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice taking a closer look at the airlines' plans to cooperate, the timing couldn't have been better.
Antitrust concerns resurface
The partnership between American Airlines and JetBlue Airways involves coordinating routes and schedules for flights to and from New York and Boston. Normally, this type of cooperation would violate antitrust law.
Image source: JetBlue Airways.
The airlines sought an exemption to the usual antitrust regulations on the grounds that teaming up would make them a better counterweight to United Airlines and especially Delta Air Lines in the Northeast. They promised to significantly increase capacity in New York -- and, to a lesser extent, Boston -- while also divesting some takeoff and landing slots to enable new competition.
Based on these commitments, the U.S. Department of Transportation gave its blessing to the partnership in January. However, antitrust regulators at the Department of Justice remain worried that letting the two airlines cooperate could lead to higher fares and worse service in New York and Boston. The DOJ's investigation has become more active in recent months, and antitrust regulators there may raise objections to the alliance, according to a recent report by The Wall Street Journal.
Time to announce more growth
To the extent that the DOJ's antitrust division remains skeptical of the American Airlines-JetBlue alliance, both airlines have an incentive to demonstrate the partnership's consumer benefits. Last week, they did just that, announcing another -- even more ambitious -- wave of growth.
JetBlue stated that it will add seven new cities to its route network between now and next summer. It will fly from both New York's JFK International Airport and Boston to Kansas City, Milwaukee, and San Antonio. It will also launch year-round flights from JFK to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and San Pedro Sula, Honduras, along with seasonal service to Asheville, North Carolina and Vancouver.

Meanwhile, JetBlue plans to add six new routes out of New York's LaGuardia Airport (mainly targeting the Southeast), while offering more frequent service on several existing routes. Between these moves and various new routes announced in February, JetBlue will operate more than 50 daily departures at LaGuardia by next summer: up from just 18 in 2019.
As for American Airlines, the full-service airline will begin flying from JFK to Delhi later this year. That will complement new routes from JFK to Athens, Tel Aviv, and several destinations in South America that it announced previously. American will also launch flights from Boston to Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Toronto: key business markets that JetBlue does not serve. Finally, the carrier plans to begin flying from LaGuardia to Houston, Oklahoma City, and Omaha.
Demonstrating the alliance's benefits
The latest round of new route additions will give American Airlines and JetBlue firepower to counter the DOJ's antitrust probe. In particular, JetBlue's new routes from JFK and LaGuardia rely on using underutilized slots held by American Airlines. American's new international routes also depend on getting connecting traffic from JetBlue.
Image source: American Airlines.
To be fair, American Airlines will have to operate fewer flights from New York to certain cities in order to free up enough slots for JetBlue. While American and JetBlue aren't allowed to coordinate pricing, fares could potentially rise in those markets due to lower capacity levels.
However, American Airlines used cramped, single-class 44- and 50-seat jets on most of the flights it plans to eliminate. By contrast, most of the new flights will use mainline jets with more than 150 seats. On a net basis, the two partners will grow significantly in New York and Boston -- driving down fares, all else equal -- while operating more customer-friendly aircraft.
American and JetBlue have planned to grow in New York and Boston all along. The threat of tougher antitrust scrutiny probably didn't change their long-term plans. However, it may have encouraged them to announce their growth initiatives quickly: After all, some of the new routes announced last week won't start up for more than a year. From what we know now, the new alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue looks like it will provide important consumer benefits while also helping both airlines.

4656.0,2021-03-04 00:00:00 UTC,Why Airline Shares Are Down Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-airline-shares-are-down-today-2021-03-04,,,"What happened
The airlines ran into a patch of turbulence on Thursday, zapping some of the momentum the sector has enjoyed in recent weeks. It's too soon to declare the ""reopening trade"" over, but it wasn't a good day to be investing based on expectations that COVID-19 would soon be in the rearview mirror.
Leading the way downward were shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE), with each stock down more than 5% for the day.
So what
For all the problems airlines had in 2020, the companies have been flying high so far this year. All four of these stocks are up at least 20% year to date, even with Thursday's sell-off, and Spirit is up nearly 40%.
Image source: Getty Images.
The pandemic was the reason for last year's declines, and hope that vaccines will allow us to return to normal in the months to come has been pushing the stocks higher. News from the White House that all American adults should have access to a vaccine in time for the summer travel season had airline stocks gaining ground yesterday.
Airlines seemed to get caught up in the broader selling downdraft on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off by more than 300 points as of 3 p.m. EST.
Now what
There might not have been much specific news from the industry to trigger Thursday's sell-off, but it is fair to ask the question of whether the industry has come too far too fast after posting such solid gains in the first two months of the year.
It seems likely that the summer vacation season might come in much better than some had feared only a few months ago. There appears to be significant pent-up demand for leisure travel, and if the vaccine is widespread, expect flights to typical tourist destinations to be full by mid-year. Spirit, with its industry-low cost structure, is set up particularly well to take advantage, and American, United, and JetBlue are all rearranging their route maps to better cater to expected demand.
The fledgling recovery should also eliminate any lingering fears that airlines including American and United will face a liquidity crisis, a relief to investors.
But the path forward is not clear for airlines, especially those like United and American that rely heavily on business and international travel. Those segments of the industry are likely to take much longer to return. Airlines have also taken on significant debt over the past year which will have to be paid off when revenue returns.
I can justify the recovery in the shares, but it is hard to say for sure most of these stocks still have a lot of room to run. Today's decline in airline stocks is not nearly as frightening as what we were experiencing in March 2020, and I don't think it is nearly the buying opportunity, either.

4458.0,2021-05-21 00:00:00 UTC,"Generalist funds flow back into mining as prices, inflation climb",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/generalist-funds-flow-back-into-mining-as-prices-inflation-climb-2021-05-21,,,"By Zandi Shabalala and Clara Denina
LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - Surging prices for commodities, stronger balance sheets and rising inflation have lured back to mining stocks generalist investors that for years shunned the sector, data shows.
Shares in diversified mining companies Rio Tinto RIO.L, RIO.AX, BHP BHPB.L, BHP.AX, Anglo American AAL.L and Glencore GLEN.L have doubled in the last year, as policy support measures in advanced economies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic stoked inflation.
Commodities serve as a hedge against inflation, meaning their prices are expected to stay strong, and at the same time the transition to a low carbon economy and channelling of stimulus funds into infrastructure is generating demand for raw materials.
The size of natural resources mutual and exchange-traded funds tracked by Refinitiv Lipper data exceeded $70 billion by the end of April for the first time since September 2018 at $72.4 billion.
Many generalist investors - or money managers whose focus is not solely on mining companies - fled the sector when a commodity boom crashed in 2015 as China's appetite for raw materials slowed down.
""The inflation fears and metals price action has brought investors back to mining stocks,"" said London & Capital head of equities Roger Jones, whose fund holds mining stocks.
A Bank of America survey of fund managers published in May found that a net 21% of European investors participating in it were overweight metals and mining versus a net 56% that said they were underweight a year ago.
The survey found fund managers were underweight defensive sectors such as utilities and pharma.
This is not only visible in Europe, as several hedge funds have piled into Canada-listed Teck Resources Ltd TECKb.TO, for example, U.S. regulatory filings show.
AVOIDING BOOM AND BUST
Miners have learnt a hard lesson since the last boom, when they overpaid by billions to buy assets, sometimes in complex jurisdictions or difficult geologies.
By maintaining discipline on costs, spending and acquisitions, they cut debt and gave shareholders dividends that have become loftier as commodity prices rose.
Prices for copper, which is expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the lower carbon economy, hit a record this month CMCU3, while battery minerals nickel, lithium and cobalt have also jumped.
Sell-side analysts have hailed the latest rally as the beginning of a supercycle, but some fund managers caution against too much enthusiasm, as supply disruptions caused by the COVID-19 restrictions ease, potentially curbing prices.
""Supply chains are still not working as smoothly because of COVID lockdowns, so we have to wait until there is a normalisation to get a better idea of what is really driving commodity prices,"" said Ben Ritchie, head of European equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
Fund managers also said China was not consuming as much metal as it was during a 2000-2008 supercycle, and mining stocks are trading on low multiples compared to tech for example, which suggests broader scepticism that prices can be sustained.
Another concern for investors has been the level of risk associated with mining that has led to environmental disasters and legal action.
As ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria have shot to prominence, miners have drawn up sustainability reports and ethical and green targets that may reassure some investors.
""ESG has been a challenge for miners to adapt to, but it is arguably the best thing that has happened to the mining sector,"" said Janus Henderson fund manager Tal Lomnitzer, whose funds hold Anglo American and copper miner Freeport-McMoRan FCX.N.
""Decarbonisation should bring in those investors who would otherwise avoid the sector.""

Asia-Pacific equity indexes ended today’s session mixed as China’s policy easing actions were deemed not strong enough for the market pushing China’s Shanghai Composite 2.26% lower, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng off 1.25% and Taiwan’s TAIEX down 0.12%. Outside of those markets, Australia’s ASX All Ordinaries rose 0.22%, Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.35%, Japan’s Nikkei advanced 1.23% and India’s Sensex led the way, closing up 1.53% on the day. By mid-day trading, major European equity indices are up across the board, and US futures point to a healthy market open later this morning.   
Investors and those equity futures will have to contend with the accelerating pace of March quarter earnings today as well as the 10-year real-yield for U.S. Treasuries turning positive yesterday for the first time since March 2020. That real-yield move reflects growing bets the Fed will adopt a more aggressive than previously expected rate-hiking cycle following the latest Fed Beige Book that showed inflationary pressures remained strong. At the same time, however, we are starting to see firms including Bank of America (BAC) and Nomura Asset Management voice the view that the panic over inflation and rate-hike bets have gone too far. 
Following that Beige Book and this morning's data that showed the Final March CPI print for the Eurozone up 7.4% YoY, we expect the market to lean into inflation and rate hike comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde at an International Monetary Fund event later today, and the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who is speaking at a different event.  
As companies have taken quick steps to extract themselves from doing business in Russia, SAP SE (SAP) being the latest to shutter business in Russia after 30 years, the race for countries to become energy independent from Russia is proving to be more difficult. This ultimately should be a boon for energy companies, especially U.S. Natural Gas providers but as we discuss below, this transition will take time and a lot of planning.

International Economy 
Final March YoY Eurozone CPI printed at 7.4%, which despite being revised down 0.1% from initial estimates is the highest this figure has ever been in the trade block’s history. This record high was realized by? A 44% YoY rise in energy prices due to the Russian invasion and ongoing war with Ukraine. 
Preliminary (Flash) April Eurozone Consumer Confidence fell to -22.7, lower than both the expected decline to -20 and significantly lower than March’s -11.6 reading.
Germany announced it will cut Russian oil purchases in half by this summer and cease buying oil from the country by the end of 2022. Russia currently accounts for approximately 35% of German oil imports and 55% of German natural gas imports.  The country has fast-tracked the development of two Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) terminals and hopes to have them operational within two years, pledging to work at “Tesla speed” to get the project completed. It is estimated that the terminals will help offset approximately 1/3 of German natural gas demand so there is clearly more work to be done before the country can claim energy independence from Russia, at least.
Domestic Economy
8:30 AM ET will see the release of Weekly Initial & Continuing Jobless Claims with initial claims expected to drop to 178,000 from the previous week’s 185,000 and continuing claims are forecasted to be lower at 1.46 million compared to the previously reported 1.475 million. At the same time, we will also see the April Philadelphia Fed Index update, which looks to track manufacturing activity in the district. Expectations are for a decline to 19.8 from the previously reported 27.4. 
Markets
The S&P 500 inched lower yesterday, dropping 0.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 moved nicely higher(+0.4%) outperformed in positive territory, while the Nasdaq Composite moved lower as the market digested March quarter results from Netflix (NFLX), which closed 35% lower on the day. Gains were registered in 8 of the 11 S&P 500. Including yesterday’s moves, here’s how the major market indicators stack up thus far in 2022:
Dow Jones Industrial Average: -3.2%
S&P 500: -6.4%
Nasdaq Composite: -14.0% 
Russell 2000: -9.2%
Bitcoin (BTC-USD): -11.4%

Stocks to Watch
Before trading kicks off for U.S.-listed equities, Alaska Air (ALK), American Airlines (AAL), AT&T (T), AutoNation (AN), Dow (DOW), Nucor (NUE), Philip Morris International (PM), and Union Pacific (UNP) are expected to report their quarterly results.  
March quarter results at Tesla (TSLA) easily beat consensus expectations as total production at the EV company reached 305,407 vehicles, up 69% YoY and total deliveries for the quarter hit of 310,048, up 68% YoY. The company also issued an upbeat long-term forecast, shared its plans to “grow our manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible. Over a multi-year horizon, we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. The rate of growth will depend on our equipment capacity, operational efficiency, and the capacity and stability of the supply chain. Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through the rest of 2022.""
By comparison, Alcoa (AA) reported mixed March quarter results with EPS coming in ahead of expectations while revenue for the quarter, which rose 14.7% YoY, came up modestly short of expectations. For the June quarter, based on current prices, Alcoa expects both alumina and aluminum realized third-party prices to be higher than those in the March quarter, with that benefit partly offset by approximately $115 million of higher energy and raw materials costs. Higher shipments sequentially are expected to more than offset remaining cost pressures and other factors.
Spurred on by the 57% YoY increase in revenue, March quarter results at Steel Dynamics (STLD) topped expectations. The company sees market conditions “for domestic steel consumption to continue to be strong this year and into 2023.” In its view, Steel Dynamics sees the automotive, industrial and energy sectors remaining solid steel consumers this year, with demand from the construction sector at the lead.  
Semiconductor capital equipment company Lam Research’s (LRCX) results for the March quarter missed both the revenue and EPS mark with the company sharing it is focused on resolving its supply issues as quickly as possible to support strong customer demand. For the June quarter, Lam sees EPS of $6.50-8.00 vs. the $8.23 consensus with revenue in the range of $3.90-$4.5 billion vs. the $4.45 billion consensus.
Rail-based transport company CSX (CSX) delivered March quarter results that topped expectations led by revenue for the quarter that rose 21.3% YoY to $3.41 billion. An overall revenue-per-unit increase of 24% more than offset a 2% decline in volume. The company targets full year double digit revenue and operating income growth, with revenue in the near term to benefit from high coal prices and fuel surcharges. 
United Airlines (UAL) reported a modestly larger bottom-line loss for the March quarter with revenue that rose ~135% YoY but still missed the consensus revenue forecast of $7.68 billion for the quarter. On a positive note, the company shared it sees the current quarter being a “historic inflection point” for its business and targets being profitable for all of 2022.

2225.0,2023-10-02 00:00:00 UTC,3 Stocks to Buy Before the Holiday Shopping Boom,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-buy-before-the-holiday-shopping-boom,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
The fourth and final quarter of 2023 is upon us and the year-end holidays are fast approaching. That could mean a boost in the sales of many businesses, from retailers to airlines and e-commerce companies. In mid-September, accounting firm Deloitte released a report forecasting that holiday retail sales will rise between 3.5% and 4.6% this year, while e-commerce holiday sales are predicted to grow between 10.3% and 12.8%. While that’s a slowdown from last year due mostly to inflation and high interest rates, holiday sales are still expected to total up to $1.56 trillion between November and the end of December this year. As usual, some companies can be expected to benefit more than others from the surge in year-end consumer spending, especially around the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping events. Here are three stocks to buy before the holiday shopping boom gets underway.
Amazon (AMZN)

E-commerce leader Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced plans to hire 250,000 additional workers for the holidays this year and boost the pay of warehouse and delivery workers to $20.50 an hour from $19. Additionally, Amazon is planning to kick off the holiday shopping season with its latest Prime Day sales event scheduled to take place on October 10 and 11 of this year.
The people hired for the holidays will include full-time, part-time and temporary seasonal workers, according to the company. Amazon appears bullish about the holidays this year, hiring 100,000 more workers than in the final quarter of last year to fulfill online orders. Analysts say Amazon’s hiring plans and autumn Prime Day sales event counter perceptions that the U.S. economy is slowing and consumers are spending less.
Amazon’s last Prime Day sales event held in July generated more than $12 billion in sales, making it the most successful Prime Day ever for Amazon. AMZN stock has increased 48% year-to-date.
American Airlines (AAL)

The latest industry data shows that 30% of Americans plan to travel during the year-end holidays, the same proportion that traveled between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Eve in 2022. And 24% of Americans said they plan to spend Christmas this year at a vacation destination. That is good news for American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), which is the largest carrier not only in the U.S. but the entire world. Strong holiday travel intentions among consumers come as the company rebounds from the Covid-19 pandemic.
American Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street forecasts across the board as travel demand surged globally. The carrier announced earnings per share (EPS) of $1.92 versus $1.59 expected by analysts. Revenue in Q2 totaled $14.06 billion compared to $13.74 billion forecasted. Additionally, the airline raised its forward guidance for the remainder of 2023, saying it expects the current travel boom to continue throughout Q4 and the upcoming holidays.
AAL stock has gained 7% in the past 12 months.
Walmart (WMT)
Discount retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is already doing well this year as financially stressed consumers turn to its stores for everything from groceries to clothing and electronics. Walmart could get an even bigger boost from year-end holiday shopping. The Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday sales events tend to supercharge Walmart’s sales. The company is already advertising its holiday deals for this year.
While Walmart hasn’t announced its holiday hiring intentions just yet, the retailer brought on an additional 40,000 workers to help it manage sales during the busy Christmas shopping season last year. That was actually down more than 70% from 2021 due to concerns about a slowing economy. This year, analysts expect Walmart’s holiday hiring to rebound. Walmart enters the final quarter of the year in good shape, having reported strong financial results due to continued strength in its grocery sales and online spending.
WMT stock has increased 21% over the last 12 months.

Trading volume may be anemic, but that hasn’t stopped investors from pushing the indices to more new highs ahead of earnings. That said, let’s look at a few top stock trades as we approach mid-week.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: American Airlines (AAL)

Declining in its sixth-straight session and in eighth of the last nine days, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) is attempting to locate a short-term bottom.
Shares are bouncing nicely from the 61.8% retracement and the 10-week moving average. A decline below Tuesday’s low may put the 50-day moving average in play too.

Below that, though, and we could see a sub-$20 move, landing AAL stock around $18.50. That’s a prior breakout spot and about where the 100-day and 21-week moving averages start to come into play.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 2: Wells Fargo (WFC)

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) will kick off the earnings party on Wednesday before the open, along with a few others. After years of lagging its peers, WFC stock is finally trading pretty well on the long side.
The question now is, can Wells Fargo keep it up?
Correcting slightly ahead of the print, we need some clarity after the event. Specifically, I either want a deeper dip down to the $37 to $38 area or a push higher above the March higher.
If it’s the former, this area was recent support last month. It’s also where the 10-week and 50-day moving averages come into play. If that area fails, the $33 area could be next.
On the upside, however, the 61.8% retracement was resistance last month. A move above the March high at $41.54 could open the door to the $45 to $47 area. Near the latter is where the 78.6% retracement comes into play.
Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Riot Blockchain (RIOT)

Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) is moving out of its wedge pattern as Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) hits new all-time highs.
For the most part, the 10-week and 50-day moving averages continue to hold as support, doing just enough to guide Riot stock higher until it broke out over downtrend resistance.
From here, let’s see if Riot stock can climb to the 61.8% retracement and the $62 to $65 area. If it can clear the March high near $68, then a run toward the high at $79.50 is possible.

On a pullback, though, I don’t want to see Riot stock break below $50. That would put it below its moving average support and back below downtrend resistance.
Top Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: Tesla (TSLA)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
At least for now, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has its groove back. Shares are bursting over recent resistance near $700 and all of its key moving averages.
From here I want to see if it can fill the February gap near $780. Above that opens the door to $800-plus.
On the downside, however, it’s quite simple: We need to see prior resistance hold as support should the stock pull back. There’s a plethora of moving averages in that area too, which we want to see hold as support. Below opens up more possible downside.

3928.0,2021-12-23 00:00:00 UTC,AAL February 2022 Options Begin Trading,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aal-february-2022-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL) saw new options become available today, for the February 2022 expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AAL options chain for the new February 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $18.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.08. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $18.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $16.92 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AAL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $18.34/share today.
Because the $18.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.00% return on the cash commitment, or 50.93% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for American Airlines Group Inc, and highlighting in green where the $18.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $18.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.18. If an investor was to purchase shares of AAL stock at the current price level of $18.34/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $18.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.31% if the stock gets called away at the February 2022 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AAL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for American Airlines Group Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AAL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $18.50 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $18.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.43% boost of extra return to the investor, or 54.61% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 52%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 53%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $18.34) to be 47%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

4772.0,2021-01-28 00:00:00 UTC,Why Shares of American Airlines Are Soaring Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-shares-of-american-airlines-are-soaring-today-2021-01-28,,,"What happened
Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) jumped as much as 30% higher on Thursday morning following the airline's fourth-quarter earnings announcement. The results came in a bit better than expectations, but weren't good enough to justify the response.
So what
Before markets opened, American said it lost $3.86 per share in the fourth quarter on revenue of $4 billion, besting analyst expectations for a $4.11-per-share loss on revenue of $3.88 billion. Revenue during the quarter was down 64% from a year prior, with the airline burning through about $30 million per day during the period.
Image source: American Airlines.
American and other airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced demand for travel. The industry has raised billions in order to survive the crisis, but is facing a prolonged recovery.
In a statement, CEO Doug Parker called 2020 ""the most challenging year in our company's history,"" and admitted the timing of a recovery is uncertain.
""As we look to the year ahead, 2021 will be a year of recovery,"" Parker said. ""While we don't know exactly when passenger demand will return, as vaccine distribution takes hold and travel restrictions are lifted, we will be ready.""
American expects first-quarter 2021 revenue to be down 60% to 65% from a year prior. The airline expects to end the quarter with about $15 billion in total available liquidity, enough to continue to manage through this difficult period.
Now what
There is nothing about American's results that stood out from other airlines that have reported, yet the stock's reaction is disproportionate to the movement of the rest of the industry.
As I wrote yesterday, it seems likely some of this movement is connected to the Reddit community WallStreetBets, which has targeted stocks with a significant number of shares sold short. American has the largest short interest of any major airline, and it is likely many of those shorts are covering their positions and bidding the stock price up out of fear of being caught in a short squeeze.
Regardless of the reason, it is too much too soon for an airline that, although positioned to survive, is not likely to be one of the first to recover. If I were running American, I'd be looking at the stock reaction and considering a secondary offering to raise cash and begin paying down some of the billions in debt added due to the pandemic. That's of course assuming the jump holds, which given the stock's movement on Thursday is no guarantee.
For individual investors, the best advice is to watch this drama play out from the sidelines.

4718.0,2021-02-09 00:00:00 UTC,Pick Southwest Stock Over American Airlines For Better Gains?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pick-southwest-stock-over-american-airlines-for-better-gains-2021-02-09,,,"The shares of American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) have declined by 38% in the past year compared to a 19% drop observed in Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) stock. Does that make American a better pick over Southwest? Given the ongoing vaccination efforts in multiple countries and the possibility of economic recovery by mid-2021, Trefis believes that Southwest stock can provide better gains to investors willing to bet on the slow-moving airline industry. Per PSP2 (second phase payroll support program) restrictions, airline companies cannot return capital to investors through dividends and share repurchases until March 2022. Despite a substantially higher current P/S multiple, Southwest stock has room for more growth as the $1.7 billion of PSP2 proceeds can completely offset the company’s Q1 losses at a cash burn rate of $17 million per day. Importantly, American Airlines’ $25 billion of net debt makes the stock subject to additional headwinds in the current low demand environment. We compare the historical trends in revenues, margins, and valuation multiple of both companies in an interactive dashboard analysis, American Airlines vs. Southwest Airlines – parts of which are highlighted below.
1. Revenue Growth
Southwest’s growth has been almost similar to American Airlines over the last three years, with LUV’s revenue expanding at an average rate of 3.5% per year from $20.3 billion in 2016 to $22.4 billion in 2019, versus AAL’s revenue which grew by 4.5% from $40.2 billion in 2016 to $45.8 billion in 2019.
In 2020, American Airlines observed 50% (y-o-y) capacity contraction with a 64% load factor. Whereas, Southwest reported 34% (y-o-y) capacity reduction with a 52% load factor – lowering the gap between AAL and LUV’s top line.
In 2020, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines reported $17 billion and $9 billion of total revenues, respectively.
2. Returns (Profits)
Southwest’s operating profit margin has consistently been 6-percentage points higher than American – mostly due to a lower share of salary expenses as a percentage of revenues.
In 2020, American Airlines reported $17.4 billion of revenues and $8.8 billion of net loss – at a net margin of -50.5%
Southwest’s net margins were much better at -24% due to significantly lower interest, salary, and depreciation costs.
Thus, Southwest observed just $1 billion of operating cash outflow compared to the larger $6.5 billion by American.
3. Risk
Per Q4 2020 filings, American and Southwest reported $32 billion and $10 billion of long-term debt on their balance sheet, respectively. After getting restructured in 2012, American Airlines’ debt-laden balance sheet has not been able to shed weight mainly due to high competitive rivalry, which limited airfares and lowered margins.
Currently, American Airlines has $6.8 billion of cash & short-term investments against total debt of $32 billion. With just $10 billion of market capitalization and a huge $25 billion of net debt, Trefis believes that AAL stock faces headwinds in the near-term. More importantly, dividends and share repurchases are suspended until March 2022 – limiting economic returns for short-term investors.
Southwest reported $13 billion of cash & short-term investments against total debt of $10 billion. Interestingly, LUV’s $26 billion market capitalization is more than twice of AAL with a significantly lower net debt.
Higher financial leverage coupled with continued revenue growth is a boon for generating surplus equity returns. However, slow growth and loaded balance sheets negatively affect shareholder returns during recessionary periods. Thus, American Airlines’ stock has lower upside potential compared to Southwest in the near future.
What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 55% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.

This week is the first big one of this reporting cycle. The season will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.
A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.
Nevertheless, five large-cap companies are set to beat Q4 2022 earnings results next week. These are Nucor Corp. NUE, American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, International Business Machines Corp. IBM, SAP SE SAP and Rockwell Automation Inc. ROK.
Q4 2022 Earnings Results So Far
As of Jan 20, 55 S&P 500 companies reported their earnings results. Total earnings of these companies are down 10.8% year over year on 7.4% higher revenues with 67.3% beating EPS estimates and 67.3% beating revenue estimates. Our current projection shows that for fourth-quarter 2022, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index as a whole are expected to decline 7.4% year over year on 4% higher revenues.
Our Top Picks
Five large-cap companies are set to beat earnings estimates this week. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and 3 (Hold) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings releases. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
The chart below shows the price performance of five above-mentioned stocks in the last quarter.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
Nucor is committed to expanding its production capabilities and growing its business through strategic acquisitions. NUE has already commissioned some of its growth projects. These should drive growth and strengthen Nucor’s position as a low-cost producer.
NUE is also seeing strong momentum in the non-residential construction market and strong demand in the heavy equipment market. NUE remains focused on achieving greater penetration of the automotive market because of the segment’s long-term growth opportunities. Higher steel prices due to tight supply and higher end-market demand should also drive Nucor’s margins.
Zacks Rank #2 Nucor has an Earnings ESP of +3.29%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.5% over the last 30 days. NUE recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.9%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.
American Airlines Group has benefitted from improved air-travel demand, particularly on the domestic front. Driven by soaring demand on healthy bookings, management expects total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be roughly 11-13% higher than the level recorded in fourth-quarter 2019.
AAL’s debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025. AAL’s codeshare agreement with Indian low-cost airline, IndiGo, is an added positive.
Zacks Rank #2 American Airlines Group has an Earnings ESP of +9.79%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 17.7% over the last 30 days.
AAL recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 8.6%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.
International Business Machines is likely to witness growth driven primarily by analytics, cloud computing, and security in the long haul. Synergies from the Red Hat buyout are boosting the competitive position of IBM in the hybrid cloud market.
International Business Machines is likely to benefit from the robust adoption and broad-based availability of IBM Blockchain World Wire — a blockchain-driven global payments network aimed at accelerating and optimizing cross-border payments. IBM is also poised to gain from the spin-off of the legacy infrastructure services business as it focuses on the hybrid cloud strategy.
Zacks Rank #3 International Business Machines has an Earnings ESP of +1.90%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 5.3% for the current year. IBM recorded earnings surprises in three out of the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 1.5%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 25, after the closing bell.
SAP’s performance is gaining from continued strength in its cloud business (especially the new Rise with SAP solution) across all regions. Synergies from recent acquisitions bode well. Frequent product launches like SAP Build augur well.

2787.0,2023-03-23 00:00:00 UTC,CSX Signs Deal Related to Paid Sick Leave With IBEW Union,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/csx-signs-deal-related-to-paid-sick-leave-with-ibew-union,,,"CSX Corporation CSX announced that it has entered into an agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). This deal, being the seventh one between CSX and rail unions in recent weeks, aims at offering paid sick leave to employees. The deal covers almost 7,700 or 46% of CSX’s union-represented workforce.
Apart from IBEW, other unions that have negotiated paid sick leave for their members are the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way, which represents track workers, the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen, representing mechanical employees, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, representing railroad machinists, and the National Conference of Firemen and Oilers, an association of CSX’s utility workers.
Such deals reflect CSX’s employee-friendly attitude through which it tries to maintain cordial relations with its employees and the unions representing them, thereby providing a healthy work atmosphere at CSX.
Joe Hinrichs, president and chief executive officer of CSX, stated, “We are pleased by the progress we are making to improve the dialogue and strengthen relationships with rail labor.” He further added, “This newest agreement, with the IBEW, is a continuation of the spirit of cooperation that we are committed to pursuing as we work together to improve the employee work experience, enhance the safety of our operations, and grow the business.”
Over the past six months, shares of CSX have gained 3.1% compared with the 1.8% rise of the industry it belongs to.

549.0,2023-03-07 00:00:00 UTC,AA June 2024 Options Begin Trading,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aa-june-2024-options-begin-trading,,,"Investors in Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 472 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AA options chain for the new June 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $50.00 strike price has a current bid of $9.55. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $50.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $40.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AA, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $51.46/share today.
Because the $50.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 19.10% return on the cash commitment, or 14.77% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, and highlighting in green where the $50.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of AA stock at the current price level of $51.46/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $55.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 29.23% if the stock gets called away at the June 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AA shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Alcoa Corporation, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AA's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $55.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 22.35% boost of extra return to the investor, or 17.28% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $51.46) to be 65%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

3749.0,2022-03-07 00:00:00 UTC,Boeing Stock Is Still Working to Clear Pandemic-Related Turbulence,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/boeing-stock-is-still-working-to-clear-pandemic-related-turbulence,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
While equity markets are trying to deal with the new set of headlines, good stocks like Boeing (NYSE:BA) are struggling to find footing. First, consider that BA stock never really got out of the pandemic crater. It fell off the global lockdown cliff and it is still trying to claw back up.
Source: Marco Menezes / Shutterstock.com
In 2020, equities collapsed, including this one, but a few sectors like airlines are still suffering. In contrast, the indices bounced off of the March 2020 lows with ferocity. They broke out from the pre-pandemic lines and took off like a bat out of hell. BA’s clients — the airlines — still don’t have their feet under them.
I would argue that the laggards were more reasonable with their reaction out of March 2020. Way too many stocks rallied far too fast for their own good. This is the reason why the indices now are struggling to find footing. We took the fast way up and the pendulum has to swing the other way now.
Luckily for BA stock it doesn’t have too far to go below before hitting the pandemic lows. Therefore, part of my thesis is that dips are still buying opportunities for long-term investors. In the end, it is still a duopoly that will do well for decades. Meanwhile, there will be turbulence due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
Wall Street recently had two violent flash crashes. The first came on Jan. 24 about the time president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis James Bullard dropped his “tape bomb.” The second was exactly a month later on the war headline in the Ukraine.
7 Hot Foreign Stocks to Buy Now Despite Global Volatility
Last week, BA stock broke through both levels violently. On Friday the stock fell 4% far more than the indices. I attribute this to the negative news escalating from the conflict in the Ukraine. Proof of this is that airline stocks like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) fell 7%. While the market was red, these two fell disproportionately deeper.
The BA Stock Recovery Is Slow But Ongoing
Source: Charts by TradingView
The fundamentals for Boeing stock are still somewhat murky. Boeing has a special business being a duopoly, so it doesn’t have many sales problems. But its clients are in still in disarray.
Technically the chart is also showing cracks from several sources. First, BA stock lost support at $200 per share. This triggered a bearish pattern that could target $160 per share. There is still time to recover from this, but it better do so quickly. Second, there is a gap that was left open from the rally last November. The bears will try to shoot for that and will eventually act as support.
I see no reason why Boeing should revert to levels from the pandemic bottom, regardless of how bad things are now they are better than when earth closed for business. Hopefully the Russian invasion of the Ukraine will stop escalating.
Therein lies another assumption that investors need to make on that front. Mine is that the leaders will come to terms one way or another. We are still struggling to recover from a pandemic that killed 6 million people. Moreover, governments have spent trillions of dollars to inflate their economies to help aid their recovery.
Bottom Line on Boeing
At this stage, I trust my instincts and not the environment on Wall Street. As such, I suggest a humble approach to investing today. Don’t allow yourself to take full positions into anything regardless of how good it looks.
If you’re already long BA stock, don’t add to your position. New investors should also consider taking only partial positions. Leaving room to add more later is essential now. We have unpredictable politicians running the world everywhere, so I am uncertain if logic will pan out.
Meanwhile, if you want insurance, you can rely on the options markets.

1888.0,2010-04-06 00:00:00 UTC,Market in a Vulnerable Position,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/market-vulnerable-position-2010-04-06,,,"On Monday, the market continued its plodding ways, but despite new 18-month highs, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJI ) just couldn't muster enough strength to conquer 11,000.
The payroll numbers that were released on Friday (when the market was closed) seemed to provide what the buyers needed to push stocks higher yesterday, but most of the buying was in the more speculative technology and small-cap sectors than in the Dow.
Apple's ( AAPL ) new iPad sales didn't meet some analysts' estimates, but nevertheless the stock rose to new highs, gaining 1.1%, and took much of the technology sector along with it. Best Buy ( BBY ), a major iPad retailer, rose as well, gaining 1.9%.
Volume was again light, and some observers blamed the lack of commitment on the fear of a possible interest rate hike by the Fed. Others worried about the earnings reports that begin next Monday, marking the start of the new quarterly earnings season.
Alcoa ( AA ) is traditionally the first Dow stock to report earnings. Yesterday, AA gained 3 cents, but it was downgraded by JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) amid rumors of an investigation of its dealings with China.
So the ""wall of worry"" continues to be climbed, and yesterday the Dow rose 46 points, closing at 10,974, the S&P 500 ( SPX ) rose 9 points to 1,187, and the Nasdaq ( NASD ) gained 27 points to close at 2,430.
The NYSE traded just 902 million shares with advancers over decliners by more than 3-to-1. The Nasdaq crossed 522 million shares with advancers ahead by 5-to-2.
Crude oil (May contract) rose $1.75 to $86.62 a barrel, and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ( XLE ) rose $1.04 to close at $59.58.
June gold gained $7.70, closing at $1,133.80 an ounce, and the PHLX Gold/Silver Sector Index ( XAU ) jumped 1.79 points to close at 173.07.
What the Markets Are Saying
One of the reasons for the slow, plodding nature of the market is that the public, having been badly burned by two nasty bear markets, are still not participating in the buying process. But neither are they selling.
Most of the wealth of the average American is tied up in IRAs, 401(k) accounts, cash, mutual funds, or long-term bonds and equivalents. If there is one thing that is common to all of these plans, it is that they are usually ""static."" By that I mean that few changes will be made at the request of the owners of the plans, and the investment managers are unwilling to take risks that could backfire and lose them their management fees.
But as we approach the resistance zones outlined on Monday , we are dealing with major potential sellers frustrated by the pace of the market. Many have held portfolios that, despite the market's bounce of more than 63% from the March 2009 lows, are still 20% to 40% underwater, and they are tired of hearing about the enormous gains made in stocks in the past year.
This makes the current market condition very vulnerable to bad news of any kind. So with prices at extremely high relative levels, a hike in interest rates by the Fed, a less-than-stellar earnings report by a major company, an unexpected war, or a host of other possible triggers could pull the support from stocks and turn profits into losses overnight.
Over 40 years of experience in this type of internal market structure leads me to be very cautious. New investments in stocks should be in very high-quality or highly predictable companies, and trades should be immediately followed with firm stop-loss orders. Momentum and momentum alone is slowly moving stocks forward against internal and sentiment readings that are excessively overbought.

1820.0,2010-12-27 00:00:00 UTC,First Glimpse at 2011 Market Targets,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-glimpse-2011-market-targets-2010-12-27,,,"China raised interest rates by 25 basis points this past weekend, and the world's stock markets did a flip - that is, all of the world's markets except in the United States. Here stocks opened lower as a result of the holiday surprise, but then spent most of the day recovering from the early losses and finally closed mixed.
Following the surprise announcement from China's central bank, the financials rallied, led by regional banks. Then technology stocks caught the breeze, and the remainder of the day was spent in a recovery. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC ) rose 1.6% and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ) gained 1.4%. And Cisco Systems, Inc . (NASDAQ: CSCO ) rose 2.4% following a Barron's article that said the tech giant is undervalued.
The energy sector fell, as did most commodities, based on the fear that an increase in rates would result in lower demand. But even in the energy and metals sectors, the losses were minimal. Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA ) fell 0.7% and the PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund (NYSE: DBB ) closed 0.81% higher.
In corporate news, H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE: HRB ) fell 7% after it said that HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE: HBC ) would not provide funding for its refund-anticipation loans. American International Group, Inc . (NYSE: AIG ) popped 9.3% after it entered into three credit facilities for a total of $4.3 billion designed to allow them to make loans.
Treasurys rose following a successful two-year note auction, which sold at a yield of 0.74%. The benchmark 10-year note rose 0.3125% to yield 3.354%, and the 30-year bond rose 0.7188% to yield 4.426%. The euro rose to $1.3155, up from $1.3116 on Friday.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 18 points to 11,555, the S&P 500 gained a point at 1,258, and the Nasdaq gained 2 points to 2,667. The NYSE traded just 467 million shares making yesterday the slowest day of the year. And the Nasdaq crossed just 263 million shares. On both exchanges, advancers were ahead of decliners by about 1.3-to-1.
Despite the fierce storm that tore across the eastern Unites States, crude oil for February delivery fell 51 cents to $91 a barrel, and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE ) fell 24 cents to $67.17. February gold rose $2.40 to $1,382.90, and the PHLX Gold/Silver Sector Index (NASDAQ: XAU ) fell 0.76 points to 220.5.
What the Markets Are Saying
How much can be gained by studying the lowest volume day of the year? Well, there are some pearls of wisdom to be gleaned from yesterday's tape action. The Chinese rate hike, coupled with a lightly staffed financial industry, had all of the ingredients necessary to produce a big low-volume sell-off. And when the Dow opened down by over 50 points, the day traders tightened their seat belts in anticipation of the big crash that never came.
Within 30 minutes of the opening, most of the early losses were erased, and the market spent the remainder of the day in a sleepy retracement that ended with mixed results. So, again, the stock market turned aside from the bad news and rallied - a very good sign for the bulls.
Yesterday, I promised that I'd provide the targets for each of the indices for the current advance. To do this, we must go back to 2008, since it is there that a major support zone was violated as the bear market entered its final plunge.
The Dow Industrials broke support in June 2008, at 11,785, and a mid-August rally failed at that spot, leading to an acceleration in downside volume as the market rolled over. That's the immediate target and equates to 1,278 for the S&P 500, and 8,365 for the NYSE Composite. The Nasdaq is a bit higher at 2,700 to 2,710.
But the overall target for 2011 is much more aggressive. Assuming that the S&P500 continues to hold above the recent breakout at 1,227, the overall target for 2011 is 1,400. For the Dow, it is 12,800, and for the Nasdaq it is 3,700. Later, I'll explain how I arrived at those numbers and provide some long-term investment ideas based on ETFs that could make 2011 a big winner for our readers .

4917.0,2020-12-09 00:00:00 UTC,Brazil's Gol is first airline to restart flights of Boeing 737 MAX,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/brazils-gol-is-first-airline-to-restart-flights-of-boeing-737-max-2020-12-09,,,"SAO PAULO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Brazil's Gol became the world's first airline on Wednesday to fly the Boeing 737 MAX commercially since the planes were grounded 20 months ago following two deadly crashes that killed hundreds of people.
Wednesday's first flight was between the Brazilian cities of Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre, according to data from FlightRadar24, a website that tracks plane routes. The Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOLL4.SA plane was due to return to Sao Paulo later in the day.
Brazil's civil aviation regulator ANAC lifted its no-fly order on the MAX in late November, following a similar decision by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
The flights are a key milestone for Boeing, which had been trying to get the plane back in service much earlier, blowing through its initial target of late 2019.
American Airlines AAL.O is expected to be the next operator to restart flights with the MAX, on Dec. 29.
Gol, which has ordered more than 100 MAX planes from Boeing, had no immediate comment.

Sept 27 (Reuters) - Airlines canceled over 2,000 U.S. flights on Tuesday and Wednesday and some Florida airports halted operations as they braced for impact from Hurricane Ian, which was set to make landfall in the state.
Airlines had scrapped 367 flights on Tuesday and 1,748 on Wednesday across the United States, according to flight-tracking website Flightaware.com.
About 1,800 flights within, into or out of the United States were delayed on Tuesday, Flightaware.com data showed.
Hurricane Ian entered the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday and is forecast to become a dangerous category 4 storm over the warm waters of the Gulf, according to National Hurricane Center forecaster Eric Blake.
It is expected to bring hurricane-force winds of up to 130 mph (209 kph) and as much as 2 feet (0.6 meter) of rain to the Tampa area starting early on Wednesday through Thursday evening.
Both Tampa and St. Pete-Clearwater airports in southwest Florida halted operations on Tuesday, while the Sarasota Bradenton Airport will suspend operations at 8 p.m. (0000 GMT) and Orlando Airport will cease operations at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday.
Walt Disney DIS.Nsaid on Tuesday it would close its Orlando theme parks on Wednesday and Thursday.
Even Florida airports not closing were experiencing major impacts. Airlines canceled about 40% of flights at Miami International Airport on Wednesday.
Florida is a major part of U.S. aviation and some airlines like JetBlue Airways JBLU.O and Southwest Airlines LUV.N typically expect 40% or more of their daily flights touch a Florida airport.
Through Tuesday afternoon, JetBlue has canceled 24% of its U.S. flights on Wednesday, while Southwest has canceled 9%.
Southwest suspended operations on Tuesday in Havana, Cuba, and is suspending operations at some Florida airports.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it was ""closely monitoring"" Hurricane Ian and its path.
Major U.S. carriers also halted some operations.
American Airlines AAL.O issued a travel alert for 20 airports in the western Caribbean and Florida waiving change fees for ticket booked by Sept. 23.

1647.0,2012-04-09 00:00:00 UTC,Stock Market Today: The Green Jacket Might Not Fit,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-today-green-jacket-might-not-fit-2012-04-09,,,"By ETF Stocks
Stocks are going to need a magic bullet of a Bubba Watson shot to get out of the trees this week. Last Friday’s Employment Situation results landed in the rough and has the indexes poised to fall to or below their respective 50 day-averages during the week.
To pull stocks out of the woods, bulls are going to need to pull off a shot that starts out under and between the trees, ascends and hooks 40 yards to land softly on the green. With a light economic schedule on tap and debt smoke rising once again in Euroland, the only club left in the bag this week is earnings.
First quarter results are next up and officially tee it up on Tuesday with Alcoa, Inc. (AA) and the biggest name of the week, Google Inc. (GOOG) reports on Thursday. Analysts believe 2012’s first-quarter profit results will produce less than 1% growth relative to the same timeframe in 2011. Additionally, the financial models on Wall Street predict that six of the main 10 sectors will produce lower results than a year ago.
As a result of the flat-line profit outlook, it is ETF Stocks view the forward guidance will be more important than actual results. Managements’ second quarter forecasts will be the deciding factor on the shot traders are likely to play next.
With risk and fear returning to the market, it could be time for investors to get a little defensive. ETF Stocks suggests considering an inverse ETF like ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ). The exchange traded fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to the inverse (opposite) of the daily performance of the NASDAQ-100 Index®.
In English, it means that if the NASDAQ-100 loses 1%, PSQ should gain roughly 1%. To get to its 50-day average, the index would need to drop roughly 3% from last Thursday’s close.
If we are at the onset of a much waited for correction, a retracement of 33% of the recent rally is the initial signpost market technicians will look for. Coincidently, that would place the NASDAQ near support at the March low of 2900ish, or 5.8% lower than last week’s close of 3080.
ETF Stocks doesn’t see ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) as a long-term investment strategy. Rather, we see it as more of an insurance policy against what looks like a rough patch ahead. Consider it your utility club with a difficult lie to play. If it all goes right and you make good contact, the ball lands safely on the green. If not, you are not likely to do too much damage and still have a clear shot to the pin to play next.

134.0,2023-05-16 00:00:00 UTC,What's in the Offing for Synopsys (SNPS) This Earnings Season?,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/whats-in-the-offing-for-synopsys-snps-this-earnings-season-0,,,"Synopsys SNPS is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 17.
The company anticipates revenues between $1.36 billion and $1.39 billion for the fiscal second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.38 billion, suggesting growth of 7.7% from the year-ago period.
Synopsys expects non-GAAP earnings between $1.62 and $1.72 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.47 per share indicates a decline of 1.2% year over year.
The software company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 4.3%.
Let’s see how things have shaped up before the upcoming announcement.
Synopsys, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Synopsys, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Synopsys, Inc. Quote
Factors to Consider
Synopsys’ second-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the growing demand for its solid product portfolio. The continuous shift to high-performance cloud computing due to the growing hybrid working environment is expected to have aided the demand for the company’s Intellectual Property (“IP”) solutions, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express 5.0 & 6.0, 800G Ethernet and DDR5 memory.
The growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI), fifth generation, the Internet of Things, high-performance computing, the Cloud and automotive is anticipated to have boosted the demand for Synopsys’ advanced solutions in the second quarter. The company is likely to have gained from growth in Fusion Compiler, which is fueled by large deal wins in the 5G, AI and server chip markets.
In the fiscal second quarter, the increasing global design activity and customer engagements are likely to have been Synopsys’ growth drivers. The strong adoption of interface and foundation IP solutions is likely to have boosted revenues for SNPS’ interface portfolio. Additionally, widespread contract wins and the increasing deployment of the Fusion Platform, including Fusion Compiler, might drive the company’s fiscal second-quarter results.
Synopsys’ partnership with industry leaders like Microsoft and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is expected to have accelerated the deployment of its cloud solutions. This might have aided the company’s top line during the quarter under review.
SNPS’ solid electronic design automation software partner base, which includes Advanced Micro Devices, Juniper Networks, Realtek, Toshiba and Wolfson, is likely to have served as a major revenue driver. Increased design investments in Synopsys’ ARC processors by automotive companies are also an upside. Further, the strong adoption of security solutions for interfaces, such as PCI Express, CXL and DDR, with more than 30 design wins across all market segments, is positive.
However, the heightened competition from the likes of Cadence Design Systems might have played a spoilsport for Synopsys. The tightening corporate budget amid ongoing macroeconomic challenges and unfavorable currency exchange rates are likely to have partially offset the benefits of the aforementioned factors.
What Our Model Says
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for SNPS this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.

Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 7%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

SMART Global Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  SMART Global Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | SMART Global Holdings, Inc. Quote
Factors to Consider
SMART Global’s strong execution and solid momentum across Intelligent Platform Solutions are likely to have contributed well to its top-line growth in the fiscal second quarter.

Strengthening Penguin's cloud-based solutions, and solutions focused on core, data center, AI and analytics are expected to have driven the company’s customer momentum in the quarter under review.

The growing traction across video, architectural and landscape specialty lighting markets, driven by the strong demand for high-brightness products, is expected to have aided sales of LED Solutions.

The solid adoption of core DDR3, DDR4 and Flash products is expected to have boosted SMART Global’s presence in the networking, telecom and storage end markets.

Increasing adoption of CV94D products, and solid momentum in design wins across horticulture, indoor sports lighting and road signage applications are anticipated to have been other tailwinds in the quarter under review.

However, the impacts of the coronavirus-induced supply-chain constraints and other uncertainties are expected to get reflected in SMART Global’s fiscal second-quarter results.

3575.0,2022-04-27 00:00:00 UTC,COLUMN-Global miners rank ESG as their top concern. Really?: Russell,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/column-global-miners-rank-esg-as-their-top-concern.-really%3A-russell-0,,,"By Clyde Russell
LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 27 (Reuters) - Environment, social and governance (ESG) issues are the top concern of global miners, knocking out commodity price risk for the first time, according to a new survey.
KPMG said it was a ""significant milestone"" as ESG for the first time topped the list of industry risks in its 12-year-old Global Mining Outlook.
While commodity price risk dropped to second place, another issue closely related to ESG, namely community relations and social licence to operate, came in third spot.
Rounding out the top five risks were political instability and nationalisation at number four, and global trade conflict at number five.
The top five risks for global miners neatly encapsulate the short-term issues as well as the overarching long-term factor of addressing climate change and decarbonisation.
The question that executives should be answering is how they are preparing their companies to deal with the longer-term risks.
KPMG points out that addressing the challenges brings opportunities to ""invest in innovative ways and adapt at a faster pace.""
The survey, released on Tuesday, shows that 72% of mining executives agree or strongly agree that ""ESG will be a cause of major disruption in the industry over the coming three years.""
If mining executives really believe this, it seems somewhat strange that they have to yet to re-organise and re-orientate their management structures and efforts to reflect that view.
Not one of the biggest listed Western mining companies has an executive with a title of chief ESG officer, and only one has a person with a somewhat similar title.
While some of the companies do have executives tasked with ESG, they also tend to have several other responsibilities, which raises the question of how much of their time and effort goes into ESG.
LOW-PROFILE LEADERS
For example, BHP Group BHP.AX, the world's biggest mining company, has Caroline Cox listed on its website as chief legal, governance and external affairs officer, a position she assumed in November 2020.
It's interesting that her legal role takes precedence in the title, and it's also worth noting that Cox has what at best could be described as a very low profile on social media.
An internet search of her name reveals only a small number of articles, mostly about her appointment and certainly very little on her role in preparing BHP to meet the challenge of ESG.
At Rio Tinto RIO.AX, it's much the same story, with the company website not listing an executive with specific ESG responsibilities, the closest being Isabelle Deschamps, who is chief legal officer and external affairs.
Appointed in November 2021 after Rio's reputation took a severe blow when it destroyed ancient Aboriginal caves in Western Australia state, Deschamps also has a low social media and internet profile.
Glencore GLEN.L doesn't list any executive responsible for ESG on its management team, while Brazil's Vale VALE3.SA appears to split the responsibility between two of its executives, although it does list Maria Luiza de Oliveira Pinto e Paiva as executive vice president of sustainability.
Among the top miners, perhaps the executive with the highest profile is Anglo American's AAL.L Anik Michaud, the group director of corporate relations and sustainable impact.
But while she has more of an active presence on such social media sites as Twitter and LinkedIn, she doesn't appear to be a leading contributor to the ESG debate.
Rather, ESG issues in the major miners are largely left to the various chief executives, as when several committed their companies to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
But these undertakings are often criticised as vague and lacking a clear path of firm commitments over specified time periods.
Overall, while the internal workings of individual mining companies will differ, it doesn't appear that the majors have aligned their management structures and efforts with what they have told KPMG is their top concern.
It's not that mining companies don't have good stories to tell. After all, they will be responsible for producing the raw materials, such as copper, nickel and lithium, needed for the global energy transition.
But perhaps they should be leading the discussion on how to boost production while at the same time decarbonising their operations.

Oct 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were set to open lower on Thursday as IBM and Tesla fell after their quarterly results, with investors awaiting more reports to see the impact of supply chain disruption and labor shortages on companies.
Some market players pointed to fading enthusiasm after the Dow Jones Industrials Average .DJI hit an intraday record high in the previous session and the benchmark index .SPX came close to its early September record.

4793.0,2021-01-16 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines and JetBlue Get DOT Clearance for Northeast Alliance,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-and-jetblue-get-dot-clearance-for-northeast-alliance-2021-01-16,,,"Last July, American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU) announced plans to team up through a new alliance covering New York and Boston. Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) closed its review of the proposed alliance. The DOT will allow the partnership to go forward in exchange for several key concessions and commitments by American and JetBlue. Let's take a look.
A new level of cooperation
American Airlines and JetBlue are planning for a level of cooperation that is unprecedented among major U.S. airlines (excluding mergers, of course). When they initially announced the partnership last year, American and JetBlue pointed to codesharing, slot swaps at New York's LaGuardia and JFK Airports, and reciprocal frequent-flyer benefits as some advantages of teaming up. These forms of cooperation are all tried and true in the domestic market, but have limited benefits.
Image source: American Airlines and JetBlue Airways.
The DOT agreement reveals that the two airlines plan to go a step further, though, by actively coordinating their schedules on routes to and from New York and Boston. That will allow them to offer more connecting opportunities and provide better time-of-day coverage on routes they both serve today.
This level of cooperation is common within international joint ventures. However, it represents a potential antitrust violation. As a result, American Airlines and JetBlue had to seek the DOT's blessing. Essentially, they had to convince regulators that the deal's consumer benefits would outweigh any harms. This became particularly critical after rivals Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines objected to the proposed partnership.
The DOT strikes a deal
Since announcing the alliance six months ago, American Airlines and JetBlue have said that the agreement would allow them to grow in New York and Boston and offer their respective customers access to more flights and destinations on a nonstop basis. But in order to gain DOT approval, the airlines had to turn those plans into clear commitments.
First, American Airlines and JetBlue will have to divest seven slot pairs at JFK Airport (four from American and three from JetBlue). They will be sold in a single block to a new permanent owner. Additionally, they will have to lease out six slot pairs at Reagan Airport near Washington, D.C. (four belonging to American and two belonging to JetBlue). American and JetBlue could potentially reclaim the Reagan Airport slots in the future, though, if they unwind their Northeast alliance.
Second, American Airlines and JetBlue are forbidden from discussing pricing or revenue management strategies or attempting to influence each other's competitive behavior. They may not discuss scheduling or capacity decisions for any route outside the scope of the alliance, either. (This is to ensure they remain robust competitors in other markets, such as South Florida.) Lawyers will be required to supervise all joint planning meetings to ensure that the two companies discuss only permitted topics.

Third, JetBlue agreed not to exit any markets it served year-round from JFK as of last February, with a few minor exceptions.
Fourth, American Airlines and JetBlue will be required to divest additional slots at JFK if they fail to meet specified growth targets in New York. Essentially, the carriers are committing to expand their combined seat capacity at JFK and LaGuardia Airports to at least 115% of pre-pandemic levels by 2025. Reporting requirements will allow the DOT to monitor the two airlines' compliance with their commitments.
Everyone wins -- if all goes to plan
It remains to be seen whether American Airlines and JetBlue can forge a good working relationship, particularly when they will remain fierce competitors in markets outside the scope of the new alliance. But the partnership has great promise if they can cooperate effectively.
For American Airlines, the partnership will provide its existing customers in New York and Boston far more nonstop flight options. (JetBlue currently has a much bigger footprint in both cities than American.) JetBlue can also supply a substantial volume of connecting traffic to support American's international routes at JFK, including new service that will launch in 2021 and beyond.
Meanwhile, JetBlue will be able to give its customers instant access to American's global route network. It will also gain access to a substantial number of slots at LaGuardia (and, to a lesser extent, JFK), enabling growth that wasn't possible previously. American Airlines hasn't fully utilized its slots in New York in recent years, and it has used inefficient single-class 44-seat and 50-seat jets on many regional routes from LaGuardia and JFK.
Consumers should win, too. American Airlines plans to withdraw all of its 44- and 50-seat jets from the New York market by the end of 2021. It will replace them with larger, more comfortable jets that include first class sections. Plus, as American and JetBlue consolidate frequencies on routes they both serve, they will be able to launch new routes from New York.

122.0,2023-05-19 00:00:00 UTC,Will Solid Top-Line Growth Buoy Workday's (WDAY) Q1 Earnings?,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-solid-top-line-growth-buoy-workdays-wday-q1-earnings,,,"Workday, Inc. WDAY is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2024 results on May 25, after the market closes. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 11.2%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.7%, on average.

The Pleasanton, CA-based firm is likely to have recorded higher revenues in the fiscal first quarter on a year-over-year basis, driven by its approach of continuous innovation and healthy demand for its applications for finance and human resources.
Factors at Play
In the fiscal first quarter, The Amenity Collective deployed a bevy of Workday solutions to break down data silos and drive efficiencies to accelerate its business transformation. These included Workday Financial Management, Workday Human Capital Management, Workday Payroll and Workday Learning. The transition to a cloud-based system to unify the lifestyle services and hospitality firm’s data into a single platform and drive front and back-office operations across the full breadth of the businesses is likely to have generated incremental revenues for Workday in the quarter.

During the to-be-reported quarter, EZCORP, Inc. selected several Workday solutions to improve its real-time visibility into costs and revenue drivers. These included Workday Financial Management, Workday Human Capital Management, Workday Adaptive Planning, Workday Strategic Sourcing and Workday Accounting Center. The solutions are likely to have helped the leading provider of pawn transactions to fast-track its digital transformation efforts for improved decision-making. This is likely to be reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.

For the April quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1,675 million, which indicates growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $1,435 million. The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at $1.10, suggesting an increase from 83 cents reported in the prior year.
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Workday for the fiscal first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.

Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -9.49%, with the former pegged at $1.00 and the latter at $1.10. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

The Earnings ESP for Jabil Inc. JBL is +3.38% and it carries a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Jun 15.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - Anglo American's AAL.L overall first-quarter production rose 9%, helped by strong copper output from the ramp-up of its Quellaveco mine in Peru and improvement in its steelmaking coal operations, it said on Tuesday.
The London-listed miner said it produced 178,000 tonnes of copper in the quarter to March, 28% higher than a year ago, and reported a 59% jump in steelmaking coal output to 3.5 million tonnes.
Rough diamond production via its global giant De Beers, however, remained flat at 8.9 million carats over the period, partly due to the transition of its Venetia mine in South Africa from open pit to a new underground section.
De Beers jointly owns Africa's largest diamond producer Debswana with Botswana, although the country is exploring other options outside their 54 year-old partnership.
The two partners are currently in talks to renew a 2011 sales and marketing agreement which entitles De Beers to 75% of the production from Debswana.

752.0,2022-05-10 00:00:00 UTC,Should iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) Be on Your Investing Radar?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-ishares-core-sp-midcap-etf-ijh-be-on-your-investing-radar-1,,,"Launched on 05/22/2000, the iShares Core S&P MidCap ETF (IJH) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $58.70 billion, making it the largest ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.
Why Mid Cap Blend
Mid cap companies, with market capitalization in the range of $2 billion and $10 billion, offer investors many things that small and large companies don't, including less risk and higher growth opportunities. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability.
Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.
Costs
Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.05%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.
It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.48%.
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 18.20% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.
Looking at individual holdings, Molina Healthcare Inc (MOH) accounts for about 0.80% of total assets, followed by Camden Property Trust Reit (CPT) and Alcoa Corp (AA).
The top 10 holdings account for about 6.08% of total assets under management.
Performance and Risk
IJH seeks to match the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 Index before fees and expenses. The S&P MidCap 400 Index measures the performance of the mid-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market.
The ETF has lost about -15.54% so far this year and is down about -12.25% in the last one year (as of 05/10/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $238.99 and $290.54.
The ETF has a beta of 1.12 and standard deviation of 28.16% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 410 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.
Alternatives
IShares Core S&P MidCap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, IJH is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.
The iShares Russell MidCap ETF (IWR) and the Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) track a similar index. While iShares Russell MidCap ETF has $26.87 billion in assets, Vanguard MidCap ETF has $47.68 billion. IWR has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VO charges 0.04%.
Bottom-Line
Passively managed ETFs are becoming increasingly popular with institutional as well as retail investors due to their low cost, transparency, flexibility and tax efficiency. They are excellent vehicles for long term investors.

3010.0,2023-01-12 00:00:00 UTC,Airlines expect U.S. operations to rebound on Thursday as FAA investigates outage,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/airlines-expect-u.s.-operations-to-rebound-on-thursday-as-faa-investigates-outage-0,,,"By David Shepardson and Rajesh Kumar Singh
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - U.S. airlines said they expect operations to return to normal on Thursday, as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) scrambles to pinpoint the cause of a computer outage that grounded flights nationally and to prevent it from happening again.
511 U.S. flights, however, were delayed and 63 were canceled as of Thursday early morning, according to FlightAware.
More than 11,300 flights were delayed or canceled on Wednesday in the first national grounding of domestic traffic in about two decades.
Major carriers such as Delta Air Lines DAL.N, United Airlines UAL.O and Southwest Airlines LUV.N said they expected normal operations on Thursday.
Shares of American Airlines AAL.O, which was not immediately available for a comment, were down about 1% premarket.
The FAA computer failure prevented airports from filing updated safety notices that warn pilots of potential hazards such as runway closures, equipment outages and construction, bringing flights to a temporary halt.
FAA officials said a preliminary review traced the problem to a damaged database file, but added there was no evidence of a cyberattack and the investigation was continuing.
The same file corrupted both the main system and its backup, said people familiar with the review, who asked not to be identified.
U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, said the panel would investigate. Republican Senator Ted Cruz called the failure ""completely unacceptable.""
""The modernization of the FAA will be expensive, and will be paid for through a combination of taxes on air travel that affect all carriers and efficiencies by larger airlines,"" brokerage Bernstein said in a note.
Arjun Garg, former FAA chief counsel and acting deputy administrator, said that it was premature to draw any conclusions about the event, but that the agency was right to ground flights if a safety system was not operational.
Garg, now a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells, said the incident was a reminder that the FAA was subject to an annual appropriation cycle, making it difficult to plan and execute major multiyear projects such as air traffic control upgrades.
""The health of that agency and its ability to deliver on its mission really is important,"" he said in an interview. ""It's a high-profile matter.""
The FAA has been without a permanent administrator since March. The Senate has not held a hearing on President Joe Biden's pick to head the agency, Denver International Airport Chief Executive Phil Washington, who was renominated last week.

Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Monday after a week of volatile trading spurred on by mixed quarterly results from big technology companies, while Peloton jumped on media reports of interest from potential buyers including Amazon.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC had a volatile start to February after Facebook owner Meta Platforms FB.O lost $200 billion from its market value on disappointing results last week, while Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O gained just as much on plans of hiking its Prime subscription rate.
""Markets finished out pretty decently last week after a tough month of January, so it does seem that you had capitulation on that Monday, and since then the market is trying to work its way up,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
""Higher earnings are helpful in the sense that estimates finally ticked up.""
Hasbro Inc HAS.O gained 1.9% premarket after the toymaker delivered a strong forecast-beating quarter, bolstered by a recovery in its television production business and price hikes.
Tyson Foods Inc TSN.N climbed 5.6% on beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit driven by higher meat prices.
Of the 278 companies in the S&P 500 that have posted earnings as of Friday, 78.4% reported above analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv.

Despite the earnings-driven seesaw in technology stocks, all three major stock indexes ended the first week of February higher.
An unexpectedly strong jobs report last week raised concerns about aggressive policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve ahead of key inflation data for January that is due on Thursday.
Robust inflation data – which hit its highest annual level in nearly four decades in December – could further bolster the case for a hawkish Fed and extend the climb in yields, hurting the nascent recovery in equity markets.
Markets are now pricing in a one-in-three chance the Fed might hike by a full 50 basis points in March and the prospect of rates reaching 1.5% by year end. FEDWATCH

BOGOTA, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The value of Colombia's mining exports recovered slightly in the first half of this year to $5.59 billion, despite anti-government protests and street blockades between April and June, an industry association said on Thursday.
The increase - from a export value of $5.18 billion during the first six months of last year, when the industry was battered by COVID-19 closures - is due principally to better gold prices which made up for continued troubles for coal.
The value of gold exports jumped 39.8% to $1.5 billion during the first half, while the value of coal exports fell 22.9% to $2.05 billion amid low global prices, the Colombian Mining Association (ACM) said in a virtual press conference.
Coal production was down slightly year-on-year in the first half, to 27.5 million tonnes, in part because of blockades which hit major producer Cerrejon.
""The great challenge in Colombia is to stabilize current coal production, to be able to operate continually, without blockades,"" said ACM president Juan Camilo Narino.
Tens of thousands of marchers took to the streets in sometimes-deadly protests earlier this year in opposition to a government-backed tax reform and other policies.
Though demonstrator numbers gradually dwindled, road blockades around the country stymied exports and led to shortages of food and other goods.
In addition to protests and blockades, Narino said the mining and coal sectors are frequently affected by legal decisions and licensing delays for new projects.
The association is maintaining its coal output target of 60 million tonnes this year, he said, after production fell 40% last year to 49.5 million tonnes.
The ACM predicts a 15% recovery in the sector in 2021 as new gold projects come online.
Glencore GLEN.L will become the sole owner of Cerrejon next year after buying out partners BHP BHP.AX and Anglo American AAL.L.
The Cerrejon mine has had repeated disagreements with nearby Wayuu indigenous communities and its largest union, which held a three-month strike last year.

optionMONSTER's tracking systems detected the sale of 9,000 March 12.50 puts for $1, which reflects a belief the shares will remain above the strike price through expiration. The volume was below open interest, but the trade represented 6 times the average turnover, so it's definitely noteworthy.
A large block of GGB shares was purchased at about the same time, which suggests activity by an institutional investor.
Gerdau rose 0.84 percent to $13.25 in morning trading and has been mostly drifting sideways since early June. The stock is down about 9 percent in the last month, while the broader Brazilian index is up about 12 percent in the same period.
Metal producers in general have lagged despite improving sentiment across the emerging markets in recent months. Today, however, they are showing signs of life--especially after Alcoa's earnings beat estimates and management made bullish comments on demand.
Given the broader improvement in the sector and GGB's ability to remain above $13, today's put seller apparently thinks that there is little risk of the stock pushing lower. The company's next earnings report is scheduled for Nov. 5.

3254.0,2022-09-16 00:00:00 UTC,Peru central bank lowers growth forecasts despite government stimulus,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/peru-central-bank-lowers-growth-forecasts-despite-government-stimulus,,,"Adds details, context
LIMA, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Peru's central bank on Friday lowered its economic growth estimates for 2022 and 2023, amid worsening expectations despite a package of government stimulus measures aimed at boosting local production.
The central bank now expects 2022 growth of 3.0%, compared with 3.1% previously, and 2023 growth of 3.0%, compared with 3.2% previously. It also predicted that annual inflation would rise to 7.8% this year and 3.0% in 2023.
This comes after Finance Minister Kurt Burneo last week launched an economic package aimed at lifting the economy at times of a global slowdown and falling copper prices, which are key to the country's economy.
Burneo had earlier in September said Peru could achieve economic growth of 3.9% in 2022, rising to 4.3% in 2023, thanks to the stimulus package, although many of its measures are still awaiting approval from Congress.
""There are no magic wands"", central bank chief Julio Velarde told a press conference, saying the bank was still examining the impacts of the government's stimulus measures.
Velarde said the bank was maintaining its 2022 fiscal deficit projection at 1.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) and at 1.8% of GDP next year.
Regarding Peru's key mining sector, Velarde said investment should decline by 3.7% in 2022 and in 2023 this decline should deepen to 16.2%, following the completion of Anglo American's Quellaveco copper project AAL.L in the south of the country.
Peru is the world's second largest copper producer and its mining exports total around 60% of the South American country's overall exports.

3885.0,2022-01-11 00:00:00 UTC,Omicron turbulence looms over U.S. airline earnings,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/omicron-turbulence-looms-over-u.s.-airline-earnings,,,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. airlines have come a long way since the spring of 2020 when COVID-19 brought the industry to its knees. Yet the pandemic will loom large when big carriers report quarterly earnings starting on Thursday.
The latest wave of the health crisis, driven by the highly contagious Omicron coronavirus variant, has caused havoc for a short-staffed industry. A multifold increase in daily sick calls as well as a series of winter storms have led to mass cancellation of flights.
For example, in one day alone, nearly one-third of United Airlines' UAL.O workforce in Newark, New Jersey called in sick. The Chicago-based carrier has 3,000 employees who are currently infected with the virus.
Since Christmas Eve, U.S. airlines have canceled more than 30,600 flights, or about 7% of the scheduled total, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware - one of the biggest disruptions in recent years.
Until the Omicron variant began to take a toll on airline operations, the quarter through December was shaping up as the industry's strongest period in two years.
The promising start prompted Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N and Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N last month to forecast a profit for the quarter. Both carriers had previously expected to report a loss.
Delta is due to report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. Analysts on average expect the Atlanta-based carrier to post an adjusted profit of 15 cents a share, according to Refinitiv data.
Similarly, Wall Street expects Southwest's adjusted profit to come in at 9 cents a share on Jan. 27.
American Airlines AAL.O on Tuesday forecast a smaller-than-expected fall in fourth-quarter revenue. Both American and United Airlines will report their results next week.
SURGE IN SICK CALLS
The virus-induced turmoil has dampened expectations of an upside earnings surprise.
Air travel demand tends to cool off in the first quarter, which should ease staffing needs of carriers. Still, their earnings could suffer if they struggle to run a smooth operation.
""If planes do not fly, airlines do not generate revenue,"" said Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrials materials and energy at research firm Third Bridge.
A spokesperson for JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O warned of additional cancellations until COVID-19 case counts start to come down. Most of the airline's crew members are based in the Northeastern United States where the Omicron variant is raging.
""Like many businesses and organizations, we have seen a surge in the number of sick calls from Omicron,"" JetBlue's spokesperson said.
The airline has cut its flight schedule through mid-January and is deploying team leaders and managers to staff frontline operations. It is also offering incentives for crew members not scheduled to work to pick up additional shifts and trips.
To mitigate the staffing issues, United Airlines is offering its pilots premium pay through the end of the month. Southwest, too, is offering pay incentives for operational employees through Jan. 25.
BUMP-UP IN COSTS
All the incentives along with flight cancellations are expected to further inflate the industry's costs, which have gone up in the past year due to efforts to ramp up operations.
Until Omicron's onset, carriers were assuming that a rebound in business and international traffic would help mitigate the cost pressure and allow them to be profitable this year.
They were all aggressively hiring pilots, flight attendants and airport staff to run more flights this spring and summer.
Surging COVID-19 cases, however, have called that assumption into question as they have brought in a new wave of border restrictions.
Last month, Delta said while it was still hopeful of a ""very strong"" summer over the transatlantic route, the Omicron variant could delay a recovery in international traffic by at least three months. The transatlantic route is one of the most lucrative ones in the world and accounted for up to 17% of 2019 passenger revenue for the major U.S. carriers.
The variant has also clouded the outlook for the industry's cash cow, business travel, as it has forced companies to further delay bringing their employees back to office.
Analysts at Bank of America Corp BAC.N reckon the pandemic's impact on corporate travel is the biggest risk to the airline industry.
""The pandemic will continue to drive travel patterns, but we think it will have the biggest impact on corporate travel,"" the bank's analysts wrote in a note.

3558.0,2022-05-05 00:00:00 UTC,Why Airline Stocks Are Falling Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-airline-stocks-are-falling-today-0,,,"What happened
Thursday is a miserable day on Wall Street, and airline stocks are caught up in the turbulence. Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL), JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) all traded down as much as 5% on the day, and shares of Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) weren't far behind.
So what
A day after stocks rallied after the Federal Reserve hiked rates, markets on Thursday gave all of those gains back. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 1,000 points midday as investors seemingly reconsidered the challenge the Fed faces in trying to control inflation without sending the economy into a recession.
For airline stocks, the thought of a slowdown could not come at a worse time. The industry was hit hard by the pandemic, and had hoped to use the 2022 travel season to replenish its cash reserves and repair bruised balance sheets. Based on airline commentary during earnings season, demand seems to be holding up despite inflationary pressures, but the prospect of a recession so soon after the pandemic-related slowdown is a reason for investors to be cautious about buying into the sector.

Spirit Airlines is likely also trading on its earnings report released Wednesday night. Spirit lost $1.60 per share in the quarter, $0.02 more than estimates, but its $967.3 million in revenue came in a bit above analyst expectations. Spirit also reiterated its commitment to its deal to be acquired by Frontier Group Holdings, rejecting a competing bid from JetBlue.
Spirit said it expects to turn a profit in the second half.
There wasn't a lot of company-specific news for the rest of the airlines, although investors might be digesting reports predicting flight delays and cancellations this summer in Florida. A combination of typical weather delays, coupled with an uptick in space launches and use of private jets, are expected to make the skies over the Sunshine State more congested in the months to come. Airlines can ill afford issues getting in and out of key Florida vacation markets, which can ripple through the network if not quickly addressed.
Now what
For now, the airlines appear to be in a holding pattern. Conditions have improved significantly since the early days of the pandemic, and the airlines so far have seen demand strong enough to pass on higher costs to consumers in the form of higher fares. But with COVID-19 cases once again on the rise in some areas, and the concerns about what the Fed's actions will mean for the economy, a lot of uncertainty remains.
The airlines will likely need at least another year to fully recover from the pandemic, and that's if all goes right. Investors need not rush into these shares anytime soon.
For those willing to buckle up and ride through the turbulence, names like Delta and Southwest appear to be the best options. There is great potential in this sector for long-term investors, but it is hard to see a way for the airlines to quickly gain altitude from here.

2242.0,2023-09-26 00:00:00 UTC,First Week of May 2024 Options Trading For American Airlines Group (AAL),AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/first-week-of-may-2024-options-trading-for-american-airlines-group-aal,,,"Investors in American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL) saw new options begin trading this week, for the May 2024 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AAL options chain for the new May 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $9.00 strike price has a current bid of 36 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $9.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $8.64 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AAL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $12.98/share today.
Because the $9.00 strike represents an approximate 31% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 93%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.00% return on the cash commitment, or 6.24% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for American Airlines Group Inc, and highlighting in green where the $9.00 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $14.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.34. If an investor was to purchase shares of AAL stock at the current price level of $12.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $14.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 18.18% if the stock gets called away at the May 2024 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AAL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for American Airlines Group Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AAL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $14.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $14.00 strike represents an approximate 8% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.32% boost of extra return to the investor, or 16.10% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
The implied volatility in the put contract example is 52%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 38%.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $12.98) to be 38%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

*Stock Advisor returns as of January 10, 2022
This video was recorded on Jan. 21, 2022.
Chris Hill: Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) takes a short-term hit as the streaming wars heat up. Our guest this week has a stock he believes could be one of the defining companies of the next decade. All that and a lot more coming up right now.
It's the Motley Fool Money radio show, I'm Chris Hill, joined by senior analysts, Andy Cross and Ron Gross. Good to see you as always gentlemen.
Andy Cross: Hi, Chris!
Ron Gross: How you doing Chris?
Chris Hill: We got the latest headlines from Wall Street. We've got a deep dive into the video game industry. As always, we've got a couple of stocks on our radar. But we begin with Netflix. Fourth quarter profits in revenue came in higher than expected for the streaming giant and they added more than eight million subscribers in the quarter, but that growth is a little bit lower than it was a year ago, and shares of Netflix fell more than 20 percent on Friday. Andy, a few things to get to here, including the fact that Wall Street freaked out over the fact that Netflix made a reference to computing streaming services in their shareholder letter.
Andy Cross: Chris, we've been talking about the competitive landscape with streaming for a while and clearly Netflix. Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos, they're not idiots, they know the environment. What really got people, I think, essentially freaked out and it was a very drastic reaction I got to say was with the guidance Chris. The quarter was actually pretty good as you mentioned, they added almost 8.3 million new paid additions, that was a little bit lighter than the estimated 8.5 million. Revenue was up 16 percent global paid memberships, total global paid memberships at 221.8 million up almost nine percent, average revenue per member up seven percent. They said retention was strong, return was down, but on the margin we didn't quite grow the acquisitions as fast as we would've liked to, based on the large subscriber base. However, Chris it was the guidance for the first quarter of this year that really got people I think, spooked because like I said, that fourth-quarter not so bad, operating margin was actually a little bit better than what they expected to on the profit line, but it was that guidance Chris.
I'm looking at the guidance going forward and looking at the quarter estimating to add 2.5 million global paid additions for the quarter versus a 5.8 million ad for a forecast, it's below trend compared to 2018, 2019. Revenue for the quarter expected to be up around 10 percent versus 13 percent estimates. That's the weakest gross since 2012. Chris, when you added altogether, Netflix is really now I think not in this hypergrowth cycle. We've seen the COVID period wane its way through a little bit as they talked about on the call and we're starting to seek Netflix now in a different environment. That has really gotten the markets a little bit concerned with what that might mean for the full year subscription memberships, revenue growth, and then ultimately, the profit picture. At least they expect to be cash-flow positive, which is a good sign, but clearly not nearly as much growth as a senior the last couple of years.
Ron Gross: A lot to unpack here. A lot of this boils down to not just with Netflix, but a lot of the streaming services, price and content. One reason I never really got behind Netflix was because I'd never thought they'd be able to work out the cost of content. I'm not even sure they have yet, but certainly the stock is up a trillion percent since I passed on it, it shows you what I know. But you got to be careful here when you assume you have pricing power and you act on that. Netflix, just raise prices last week, they bumped their standard plan to 1399 per month from 1399-1549. That makes their standard plan more expensive than HBO Max. You got to be careful here because there's a lot of folks, whether it's Disney Plus, Apple TV, Paramount, Peacock, we can keep on going down the list. At some point people say the content's not worth it to me. Netflix does have the content's still, it's still in high-end demand. Six of the top most searched globally, we're on Netflix in 2021, Squid Game among them, I don't think I've seen any of the top 10 most search shows. Again, take what I say with a grain of salt, but the content is good there, but you got to be careful on the pricing side.
Chris Hill: Andy, with respect to the pricing, it really seemed for consumers there are two tiers now. You've got HBO Max and Netflix around $15 a month. You've got Apple, Peacock, Disney Plus they're all single digits, less than $10 a month.
Andy Cross: Let's not forget this is Netflix's game, Squid Game, game, get it how I did here, guys. This is all Netflix does. Amazon Prime, Disney Plus even HBO Max. They have multiple [laughs] layers to their businesses. This is all Netflix does, and it's one reason why I think they've been able to spend that amount of capital on their acquisition, acquiring content and so much on content including now gaming Chris, they started their gaming little tiny gaming platform in November. If you think about Squid Game 1.65 billion hours within the first four weeks, Bridgerton 625 million hours, which are 484 million hours, Red Notice, 363 million hours. As Ron mentioned, they have the content, I think they've been very effective with it. I think they do have that little pricing power. Chris, you do mention like it is Netflix and HBO Max are there and it is remains to be seen whether members and subscribers will continue to pay up for it, but at least a churn number continues to be very impressive and I think that's a very good sticking point for investor to lock onto as they think about what the growth prospects and importantly, what the profit and cash flow prospects for Netflix looked like over the next year or so.
Ron Gross: I think it's also interesting to note that a lot of Netflix's growth seems to be now concentrated overseas in Asia and Europe, with America and Canada being somewhat more of a mature market. But coming up on the outside is Disney, which has recently formed a new international content group to expand its pipeline of content across international markets. They're looking at double the number of countries where Disney Plus is available by fiscal 2023, they've already invested in creation of content in 340 titles already in various stages of development. As we started this conversation, the competition is going to be a big part of Netflix's future.
Andy Cross: In that line that they had in the release in the call, while this added competition may be affecting our marginal growth sum, we continue to grow in every country and region in which these new streaming alternatives have launched. Now, Ron, to your point, there's global competition, 90 percent of the new additions come from outside the US and Canada for Netflix and that marginal growth, Chris, I think is what many of us are locking onto because that could be the difference really on the profit curve and the expectation. But also this is a big analysts game. Like this was a big miss from them. Lots of conversations about how they miss this much and when you look at the history of Netflix yes, in various points, they have missed along their estimates this amount on the past year or so been very volatile with all the COVID announcements, but over time they can consistently grow and return and provide that content and the experience and that experience is very valuable for the members. I think it's a winning strategy from Netflix going forward.
Chris Hill: Microsoft is making its biggest acquisition ever, buying Activision Blizzard for just under $70 billion in cash. Assuming regulators don't derail the deal, it is expected to close next year and signals Ron, among other things, Microsoft's ambitions, both for gaming and the metaverse.
Ron Gross: For sure now, I will fully admit that I didn't get the 2016 LinkedIn acquisition, I'm not even sure I still get it, I get. This one I think makes good sense, $69 billion all-cash deal Activision had been done about 40 percent from its 52-week high as it dealt with sexual harassment and misconduct allegations, Microsoft clearly taking advantage of that price weakness to, as you said, make its largest acquisition ever. CEO Bobby Kotick, who has been under pressure to resign, will remain CEO for the time being, but I wouldn't be surprised if that didn't last much longer after the deal closes. Activision as a company, will report to Microsoft Xbox head Phil Spencer. Interestingly, shares are trading well below the 95 dollar acquisition price due to, as you mentioned, antitrust concerns. I do predict this deal will ultimately go through though. Interesting to note, Microsoft's current fortunes, I say current, over the last several years have really been tied to its B2B businesses, it's business to business, business. Specifically its transformation under statute in the Della into a Cloud company.
But it's also made investments in its consumer Xbox gaming business, which is a smaller business as when you look at the whole of their revenue, they bought Minecraft maker in 2014. The maker of Minecraft, they bought the parent company of Doom and Fallout in 2021. This acquisition will be a big help to Microsoft's plan to turn its Game Pass subscription service into what they're going to call the Netflix of gaming, or what analysts are calling the Netflix of gaming. Once the acquisition closes, Microsoft said it will be the third largest game company by sales with 30 games studios. It'll include powerhouse franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and my, I guess favorite, Candy Crush. I never understood that one either to be honest. But listen, you want to talk about the big battles, big competition out there, this acquisition is also a shot across the bow to Facebook as the metaverse, which is currently focused largely on gaming, at least right now, that really will start to take shape. This is an interesting move from that perspective. Shares of Sony also weak as the acquisition is seen as the potential threat to its PlayStation business. Lastly I'll say, 15 percent upside to the acquisition price, with the main risk being the justice department kills the deal. I personally would take those odds, 15 percent upside looks good to me.
Chris Hill: Andy, I don't think Ron was alone in 2016, scratching his head on Microsoft buying LinkedIn for 26 billion, but Nadella and his team made that work and that business is thriving underneath Microsoft. You have to like the prospects for Microsoft's gaming division over the next 5-10 years.
Andy Cross: Well, I think what's really interesting is because gaming is becoming full on Cloud. It's really pushing to the Cloud. Ron kicked it off and teed it up very well with Satya Nadella's and his team's move to the Cloud and the importance of the Cloud. Even LinkedIn, that acquisition, that is very Cloud-based when you just think about distributed intelligence across various different data points that they have and collecting more and more data. I think the Cloud initiative, this does really tie into that. Yes, there certainly will be antitrust concerns and they're going to maybe have as much up to 15 percent of the total market as Ron alluded to and talked about. When you look at Microsoft's Xbox, the Game Pass subscription service, tie them together. The Cloud push, I think this continues to strengthen Microsoft's goal to really be distributed leader in Cloud computing in lots of different ways beyond just B2B.
Chris Hill: On Thursday, shares of Peloton fell 25 percent on reports. The company was halting production of its bikes and treadmills due to lack of demand. The stock regained some of that loss on Friday after Peloton CEO John Foley said the company is looking to right size production levels and consider layoffs. Ron, you have to think that between the prospect of layoffs and the way the stock has fallen over the past six months. Morale at Peloton has got to be low.
Ron Gross: Absolutely. This started as a leaked memo. Supposedly they have found out who the leaker is and they're taking action there, but the company was forced to come out and address what we're really rumors up until they came out to talk about the second quarter and the business in general. Listen, the business pulled forward so much demand as a result of the pandemic. It's a miss from their perspective on how much that was going to decline once the pandemic started to fade. Yes, I do believe that a lot of the information released in the memo is likely to happen. They're going to temporarily halt production, both the bikes and the treadmill. They do probably have thousands of cycles and treadmill sitting in warehouses because the demand just isn't there. Second quarter results, they were able to reiterate some guidance to, I think, calm the markets down, that's why I think we see a little bit of rebound. But they said they don't expect to be EBITDA positive until fiscal 2023. I think layoffs are on the table, Peloton's working with McKinsey & Company to look for opportunities to cut costs. Again, those could include layoffs, store closures, and some pulling back. Price is a big aspect here, those bikes are pretty expensive. The subscription monthly cost is pretty expensive, so Peloton has some work to do to right size this business.
Chris Hill: After the break, we've got the latest on airlines, consumer goods and more. Stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Chris Hill here with Andy Cross and Ron Gross. Two major airlines out with fourth quarter results this week. American and United Airlines both wrapping up their fiscal years with a loss and shares are both down this week. Though, Andy, United's CEO Scott Kirby says he is optimistic about the spring and summer. I know airlines historically have not been the greatest investments, but when you think about how they tie into so many different industries like travel, hotels, restaurants, I really hope Kirby's right.
Andy Cross: Both United and American are fairly optimistic about what they're seeing. They're starting to see their capacity, of course, continues to not be where it is. For United specifically, capacity was down 23 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2019. They compare against 2019 because 2020 was all wacky with COVID. Operating revenues down 25 percent, available seat miles down three percent, so a little bit better. Costs continue to increase, that was up 11 percent on the seat mile basis versus 2019. Cargo for both companies continues to be a big driver and a big win. The cargo for United is now 10 percent of the revenues up from three percent in 2019, so very impressive. But like you said, the bookings and cancellation, Kirby said, starting to return back to normal. These demands still not so great, but improving. They expect capacity to be down only 16-18 percent, operating revenue to be down in only 20-25 percent in the first quarter. Available seat miles to be attractive too, so they expect to end 2022 with the available seat miles minus the fuel cost to be about at the run rate of 2019. You are seeing this optimism from United Airlines, you're seeing that the new CEO at American Airlines, Robert Isom is coming in, stepping over, taking over in March from Doug Parker. That's the largest airline they have in the world. Their cargo revenues were attractive as well, now 30 percent higher than their previous quarterly record. Capacity was down only 13 percent. Leisure travel is approaching 100 percent recovery. Both these companies are starting to see the winds of the COVID challenges starting to dissipate and they're starting to see that travel come back. Business travel continuously be the one that's still uncertain, but there's some glimmer of hopes in the forecast here.
Chris Hill: Shares of Procter & Gamble up this week after second quarter profits and revenue came in higher than expected. More noteworthy than the result is the fact that for the second quarter in the row, P&G is raising prices across a range of items from personal healthcare products to Tide detergent. Ron, we talk about pricing power. Look, this is a Staples company. You don't automatically assume they have it, but they're flexing it.
Ron Gross: Yeah, you nailed it Chris. That's the story here. The stocks trading basically at its all time high, strong business and pricing power, allowing it to deal with the higher costs across the board that have really been taking a whack at margins and will continue to, but at least their ability to raise prices mitigates that. For the quarter, sales up six percent driven by a three percent increase in shipment volumes, but three percentage points increase due to pricing. Again, that helped offset commodity and freight increases. CEO said the company has announced price increases in all of its product categories effective February 28th. The company will increase prices on the balance of its fabric care portfolio including Tide, Gain, Downy, Bounce, all your favorites. Again, they have the ability to raise prices. It'll remain to be seen if people turned to alternatives once those pricing hikes kick in, but I have a feeling they're going to make it through this. For the quarter, their healthcare segment was the strongest with an eight percent sales increase, beauty came in the weakest with a two percent increase. They've raised their revenue outlook for fiscal '22, but they only confirmed their earnings guidance of a 3-6 percent increase. That's because the guidance included 2.8 billion of after-tax headwinds due to these higher costs. But the company is doing what they need to do and it remains a strong consumer goods company.
Chris Hill: All right guys, we'll see you a little bit later in the show. Up next, Aaron Bush weighs in on the ripple effects in the video game industry after Microsoft's big deal, as well as a couple of smaller companies investors should keep their eyes on. Stay right here, this is Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me is Aaron Bush, advisor here at the Motley Fool. Thanks for being here.
Aaron Bush: Thanks for having me, Chris.
Chris Hill: I don't know anyone who studies the video game industry like you do. Earlier in the show, we had talked about Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard. What does this do to the industry landscape? There's been talk this week of smaller players in the industry, independent game creators. If you're one of them, are you excited by the growth prospects for the entire industry? Are you terrified by the behemoth that is Microsoft, or is it something in-between?
Aaron Bush: Yeah. You're definitely thinking hard about what it means for yourself. But let's zoom out for a moment really quickly. 2022 is really destined to accelerate the video game industry's consolidation that we saw pick up and break records last year. A couple of weeks ago, Take-Two acquired Zynga for about $12 billion. That was the largest video game acquisition ever. Microsoft announcing the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for about $70 billion just immediately shatters that record and hyper accelerates consolidation. There are a couple big picture reasons why that acceleration of consolidation is happening, that points toward how deals like this one are changing the industry landscape and are making, all of the companies figure out their place and its future. First, at a high level, we're seeing the increasing dominance of ecosystems. Basically, instead of game publishers like Activision or EA being the top dogs like they were over the past couple of decades, the big players going forward really are those who own multiple pieces of the value chain in one place.
They are owning, the hardware, the storefronts, the developer tools, the Cloud infrastructure, lots of content, etc. When it comes to Activision and Microsoft, Activision is really helping Xbox bolster a key component of its broader ecosystem that's going to be harder for others to compete against unless they also bolster theirs. The second, bigger and more centralized ecosystems lead to the emergence of new business models, namely subscriptions. Like we've seen in video, where there's a flywheel between investing in content and scaling subscribers, I think, we're going to see a similar trend happen in gaming. When a company like Xbox with its Game Pass subscription or PlayStation is able to bring votes of IP under a single subscription or even a couple tiers of subscriptions, it immediately becomes more competitive, and that competition really drives even more heightened consolidation. This is something that the big platforms can do much more successfully than independent publishers, which have much smaller libraries.
Between emerging multipronged ecosystems and shifting business models that lend themselves to consolidation, a deal like Microsoft buying Activision makes sense. It's a pretty huge deal for the industry. I really think it's a shot heard round the world that these ecosystems are stepping up in a huge way, and that consolidation is going to accelerate. If I'm an independent creator or relatively a small business, I'm not necessarily scared. There's still many ways to win, many ways to sell games. But at minimum, I'd be figuring out how to better interface with these increasingly giant ecosystems, and perhaps, even be thinking about how my business, would get consolidated into a larger player as well. We almost definitely won't see a deal surpass this one. This one was massive, and very few gaming companies are even this big. But we definitely will see increased consolidation in the console PC realm, but also, in mobile tale.
Chris Hill: If it's a shot heard round the world in video gaming, it's also seen as Microsoft increasing their shot at owning a corner of the metaverse, for lack of a better term. How soon do you see gaming fitting into the metaverse? I think, anyone who really thinks about it, there are obvious applications there. Is that going to be the first significant business industry within the metaverse?
Aaron Bush: Well, I think the metaverse is still very much a buzzword, that if you put someone like Mark Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella in the same room, they're probably not going to agree on what it means or what it's supposed to be. I think we have to keep that in mind. But really, when I think about the metaverse, it really is about an evolution of a more immersive Internet, and based on that oversimplified definition, gaming has been that for a long time. As it's grown and become more complex and more users are participating in these worlds, it certainly fits the bill in being a component of what the metaverse will entail. Gaming is not the metaverse, but I think it's going to be a subsection of it. When it comes to where a lot of the innovation is going to be, improving technology, testing new business models, I do think that gaming is going to be a place where that happens. Whether or not Microsoft and Xbox are really going to be pioneers for what the future of the so-called metaverse is going to be, that's really to be seen. I think it's just going to be something that the entire world, all of these companies together, push forward together. It's not going to be owned by a single company or a handful of companies but, it certainly is an exciting trend.
Chris Hill: Let's move away from Microsoft for a minute. What business in the gaming industry that particularly excites you at the moment, and why?
Aaron Bush: Yeah, so I am regularly impressed with Roblox, particularly, RBLX, which is a user-generated content platform that has scaled tremendously over the past couple of years. I think that Roblox could be one of the defining consumer companies of the 2020s. Roblox has really taken off with kids, first and foremost. But I'm incredibly impressed with how the company has maintained its top dog status. How we've seen tremendous growth in developer interests on the platform, how it's been working to age up the platform and expand around the world, how it's been involving big brands, and how it's heavily reinvesting to improve its platform. There are other UGC platforms out there, other virtual worlds out there. But I think that people underestimate how much of a lead Roblox has. Roblox's scale, allows it to reinvest in both creators and R&D, in a way that other smaller contenders simply can't match. As these reinvestments build, I think, that the lead over others is also going to compound. I'm really excited to see where a company like Roblox is 5-10 years from now. I imagine it's going to be both much more important as a platform, and its effect on culture in the world, than it is today. If it can pull that off, it's almost definitely going to be a much larger business tale.
Chris Hill: Last thing and then I'll let you go. This can be a CEO, this could be a game developer, a trend, a company. What is something in the industry right now that you think is not really getting as much attention as it probably deserves? As you indicated, you look at the deals earlier this month, that's taking up a lot of the oxygen. What's something that should be getting more attention?
Aaron Bush: I have my eye on the emergence of blockchain games. At their core, these games are pioneering a movement, where players actually own the assets in the game that they play with. Sometimes these games have a native cryptocurrency or two that facilitates a more open in-game economy than traditional games do. For example, you could play a card game, where you actually own and can, therefore, trade the cards in your collection, for essentially real money. Or you could play a big open-world game where your characters, armor and weapons, maybe even the character itself, is yours. If you put 100 hours into a game and win a lot, you might be able to actually benefit financially from playing. There's a lot of skepticism around this trend, I'll admit, especially around how to make games that are both fun and financialized. Most games do not need blockchains at all. But I also see pretty tremendous experimentation, game design innovation and a massive flow of talent and capital to these new studios. I think it's going to take a couple of years to really get going. But in the same way that mobile gaming brought a whole new group of players and revenue streams to the gaming industry over the past decade, and it was a tremendous source of growth for the industry, I suspect that this movement will have a similar effect in the next decade. I think that blockchain games, more than any other segment of the gaming industry, are going to push the boundaries of the ecosystem in the coming few years. This isn't really a stock market play, but a lot of these assets are still going to be traded publicly, and many already are. I think, it'll be at minimum a fun movement to watch, but potentially also, be a lucrative one.
Chris Hill: Aaron Bush, always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.
Aaron Bush: Thanks for having me.
Chris Hill: Coming up after the break, Andy Cross and Ron Gross return with a couple of stocks on their radar. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money, Chris Hill here, once again with Andy Cross and Ron Gross. Our new email address is podcasts@fool.com. Drop us a note if you have questions or feedback on the show, as I have said in the past, if there's something we could be doing better, please tell us. But if you like the show, please tell others, [laughs] tell a friend, post a review on your favorite podcast app. If you like the show, please spread the word and help us out, we appreciate that. Couple of stories before we get to read our stocks guys. Amazon announced it is opening its first ever bricks-and-mortar clothing store later this year, named Amazon Style. The store will be located in the greater Los Angeles area and offer fashion brands that the company says customers are familiar with. Andy, you bullish on this idea.
Andy Cross: I actually am Chris, I think it's really interesting. Ron, this is basically the metaverse in-person here for your shopping experience, you can use the app to scan a QR code to select clothing that is displayed. Again, it's all through the Amazon app. Right there they have you in there. A sales associate will then bring them to your dressing room or robots will bring them probably if not now, maybe sometime in the very near future. What's pretty cool is that inside the private dressing rooms there's a bunch of them from what I can tell. The Amazon provides these customized suggestions for you, tailored to what they know about you, tailored to where your shopping experience is right there, in a touchscreen, you can select, you can read, you can say I want this, I don't want this, I like this, I don't like this. They have it all there. Really it's bringing the physical and the virtual together in a shopping experience. Amazon Style is built around personalization, what they say are machine learning algorithms, produced tailored real-time recommendations for each customer as they shop. Pretty interesting how Amazon is really infusing their Cloud experiences, their distribution, their consumer app, and the shopping experience that many of us are looking for.
Ron Gross: I chuckled at first, but then when I dug in a little bit, I was like, that's neat. One thing I was unclear, it appears to me you don't actually leave with the clothes, you order them online once you decide what you want. If I'm right about that, that's a little weird to me.
Andy Cross: I think it's both. I think you can do both from what I can tell. What I like about it is it makes those dressing rooms that are bland and stale and very lonely, if not intimidating. It actually makes them engaging and fun.
Chris Hill: If any of our listeners in the Southern California area want to do a little boots-on-the-ground research later this year, drop us a note, let us know how that goes. This week at the RV SuperShow in Florida Winnebago unveiled its electric RV camper. Not only does it provide power to run appliances inside the vehicle, but the battery also enables the vehicle to travel a range of up to, wait for it, 125 miles. Ron, I applaud the efforts here, but I think if you're driving the highways and byways of America, aren't you looking to put more than 125 miles in a given day?
Ron Gross: Clearly, yes. I think this ERV right now it's merely a concept, and Winnebago says that, as battery technology evolves, there's a potential for additional range. I would certainly hope so, because I don't think a 125 miles is getting anyone too excited. If you look at it, it looks like a large minivan to me, not really an RV, but I'm not an RV expert. But it has a bed, a kitchenette, and a wet bath with a shower, which I didn't know gave me the scabies a little bit. But I guess [laughs] if it was bigger, maybe it wouldn't freak me out that much. It could charge in 45 minutes, supposedly, using high-speed public charging. This is the infancy, I think, of ERVs and we'll see how they evolve.
Andy Cross: Look, at least if you're stuck out in the woods someplace, when your battery dies, at least you have the amenities to take care of yourself for a couple of days in the RV.
Chris Hill: On that note, do you guys think that charging stations are going to start to be a new amenity that hotels, Airbnb's, etc. start to push from a marketing standpoint, as more people are going electric with their vehicles. That hotels and motels are saying, ""Hey, we've got charging stations"". It's come in handy, particularly if my Winnebago EV is only going to get me a 120 miles.
Andy Cross: Pilot J2. All those along the highway it's going to be critical, sorry Ron.
Ron Gross: I do think you'll start seeing hotels, for example, start adding that as amenities, but they're not going take the hit to margins, nothing is for free. You're going to see a slight uptake in the cost of your room, and that will include the ability to charge your car.
Chris Hill: Hey, your Tesla might be nice and stylish and sleek and all that. It doesn't have a bed in it. [laughs] Your Tesla doesn't have a kitchenette in it, does it?
Andy Cross: Not yet.

It covers everything from how to set up a brokerage account, to 401k, to buying your first stock and it includes 15 stocks and five ETFs that are selected by our investing team, and it's free. Just go to fool.com/starterkit. Let's go to our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd. He's going hit you with a question on your radar stock. Andy Cross, you're up first us this week. What are you looking at?
Andy Cross: I was looking at symbol RH, is the former Restoration Hardware store founded in 1979, provides high-end luxury housewares, operates 68 galleries, 14 waterworks stores across the US and sales online through RH.com and a few other different sites. Markup of 8.7 billion stock at $400, is at a 52-week low. Growth is very attractive, 19 percent last quarter to really redesign itself over the years. CEO Gary Friedman is a former COO of William-Sonoma, is serving this massively large and very fragmented home furnishing businesses. Excellent operating margins north of 20 percent, growing 15-20 percent per year, buys back a lot of stock at various points, EPS of around $22. That can probably grow, I think 15 percent a year or so. Stocks not very expensive at about 15 times for a pretty high-quality business Dan.
Chris Hill: Dan question about RH.
Dan Boyd: How big can the market for our age actually be, Andy? I'm a homeowner. Every time I look in their catalog, I look at those prices and I laugh out loud, [laughs] so high.
Andy Cross: By the way, those catalogs are massively thick, aren't they? Yes, it's a very large market especially when you think about the housing market and the evolving home market that were seeing in the US. It's a pretty large market and people are looking for different expressions to showcase their furniture and RH is serving it Dan.
Chris Hill: Ron Gross, what are you looking at?
Ron Gross: I'm going to start the year off by circling back to the gene therapy space I talk about from time to time on the show. These stocks have been absolutely crushed alongside other innovative tech stocks that are, let us call pre-profitability. Today I'm going to focus on Intellia, NTLA down 56 percent from it's 52-week high. I could easily talk about edit toss of 70 percent, CRISPR Therapeutics off 65 percent and many others. First off, I think I should know, I don't think these stocks should have really ever achieved those highs. The stocks got ahead of the actual progress of the companies. Based on an understandable excitement from investors that gene therapy could potentially change the face of medicine. But that world altering change isn't going to happen tomorrow. We honestly don't even know if the CRISPR-Cas9 technology is going to be the silver bullets, so buyer beware. But back to NTLA, made history last summer when it became the first biotech company to successfully edit DNA inside the human body. They've got a strong balance sheet, 1.1 billion in cash, that's essential for an early stage biotech company that is not profitable. Again, these investments, not for those that are risk averse, buy a bundle, buy any ETF, diversify your risk.
Chris Hill: Dan, question about Intellia?
Dan Boyd: Maybe not about Intellia, but I just want to congratulate all spin Dr. Ron over here in coining the phrase pre-profitable. But Ron, you're not fooling me. I know what pre-profitable means. I know it means not profitable.
Ron Gross: Not profitable, yeah. Some of these companies are actually profitable if you look at their income statement because they receive big milestone payments from partners, for example, Intellia has Regeneron as a partner, CRISPR has Vertex. But that's not real profitability, that's sustainable in my opinion. As analysts, we've got to be honest there.
Andy Cross: For profit, Dan, you got to go to homework.
Chris Hill: What do you want to add to your watch list Dan?
Dan Boyd: I think I'm going to RH Chris, the appeal of a $7,000 couch just won't go away. [laughs].
Chris Hill: Andy Cross, Ron Gross, guys, thanks for being here!
Andy Cross: Thanks, Chris!
Ron Gross: Thanks, Chris!
Chris Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money radio show. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill, we'll see you next week!

Optimism currently surrounding American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock following its Q2 earnings release seems exaggerated. 
Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com
A recent Barron’s article even went so far as to call American Airlines “the year’s best airline stock.” The article didn’t explain the arguably hyperbolic claim, but I can assume that it was based on year-to-date price appreciation among the big four U.S. airlines. 
AAL shares have appreciated in price by roughly 27% year-to-date. Delta (NYSE:DAL) is down about 2%, United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) stock has risen by 6.5%, and Southwest (NYSE:LUV), roughly 7%. 
So, yes by that standard it is the best airline stock yet in 2021. But that hardly means much and isn’t a convincing reason to get into a position in AAL currently. 
Hit Hard Due to Size
American Airlines was the worst hit during the pandemic. It went into the pandemic as the largest airline as measured by fleet size, and remains so. The high operating costs of maintaining the world’s largest idle fleet was one of several reasons American was considered at high risk of bankruptcy early in the pandemic. That threat didn’t materialize, but American Airlines isn’t attractive either. 
6 A-Rated, Safe Stocks to Buy With Dividends
American Airlines remains middle of the pack at best. Throughout the pandemic you would have been hard-pressed to find headlines which suggested American was a better investment than Southwest or Delta. That remains true today. 
Profits 
American Airlines’ July 22 earnings report was filled with positive news.  Well, the details and presentation were ostensibly meant to portray the company’s direction as positive anyway.  
American Airlines did post a second quarter profit of $19 million. That’s a very modest number for an organization of its size, but a positive number, nonetheless. 
Yet, at the same time investors can’t simply rely on such profit figures without the benefit of context. Southwest managed to post a profit of $348 million in the same period. Analysts were sure that it would rebound quicker than American Airlines as it is operationally much more sound. By that metric, it has. 
Further, $19 million is merely a drop in the bucket to AAL stock s at its scale. At the height of the pandemic in April of 2020 the company was burning through $100 million in cash every day. In the fourth quarter of 2020 that figure was still around $30 million per day. 
Paying Down Debt
Thankfully, the company has fixed its cash burn issue to a degree. It reported that it has entered a cash build period of $1 million per day in the second quarter. That is all good and well and serves to entice investors. But I would caution that investors exercise a bit of restraint in regard to the company’s debt plans. 
As it stated in the earnings report: “The Company now expects to reduce its debt by more than $15 billion by the end of 2025 versus its previous guidance of $8 billion to $10 billion.” This is little more than a rough estimate based on optimism from opening air travel.
American did pay down a $950 million loan due in April of 2023 but remains highly levered. 
Too Early for AAL Stock
Although travel has opened up it remains too early to understand the ramifications of the pandemic on the airline industry. The Delta variant of Covid-19 makes the reopening more difficult to judge. It could deal a blow to airlines. But even without attempting to factor it in, there is another sign American has trouble. 
The yield of AAL stock is down. Yield is a calculation of the average fare per passenger per mile. It’s 10.1% lower throughout the first half of 2021 than in 2020. Yes, there are multiple potential explanations, but the thrust is still negative. 
Overall, AAL stock remains one of the weaker airlines despite the rosy prognostications of management.

In Monday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major averages closed higher. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) climbed over +7% and was the top percentage gainer on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 after Morgan Stanley said the recent decline in the stock is a “good entry point” ahead of its Q2 results next week. Also, United States Steel Corporation (X) surged more than +36% after the company rejected a $7.25 billion cash and stock takeover offer from Cleveland-Cliffs and said it would initiate a formal review of its strategic options. In addition, Monday.Com Ltd (MNDY) rose over +8% after reporting upbeat Q2 results and raising its full-year revenue guidance. On the bearish side, Tesla Inc (TSLA) dropped more than -1% after the automaker said it had cut prices in China for Model Y Long Range and Performance versions. Regional bank stocks also retreated, with KeyCorp (KEY) plunging over -4% and Comerica Inc (CMA) falling more than -3%.
“It’s the first day in a while that tech has really significantly outperformed. I think that’s indicative of the fact that you have this blockbuster Nvidia report coming up, and that could support the tech market pretty substantially,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors.
Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in an 88.5% probability of no hike and an 11.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate increase at September’s monetary policy meeting.
On the earnings front, major companies like Home Depot (HD), Suncor Energy (SU), Alcon (ALC), and Agilent Technologies (A) are slated to release their quarterly results today. 
Today, all eyes are focused on U.S. Retail Sales data in a couple of hours. Economists, on average, forecast that July Retail Sales will stand at +0.4% m/m, compared to the previous value of +0.2% m/m.
Also, investors will likely focus on U.S. Core Retail Sales data, which came in at +0.2% m/m in June. Economists foresee the new figure to be -0.3% m/m.
U.S. Export and Import Price Indexes for July will also be in focus today. Economists anticipate Export Price Index to be at +0.2% m/m and Import Price Index to stand at +0.2% m/m.
U.S. NY Empire State Manufacturing Index will be reported today as well. Economists foresee this figure to stand at -1.00 in August, compared to the previous number of +1.10.
In the bond markets, United States 10-Year rates are at 4.228%, up +1.02%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 futures are down -0.78% this morning as apprehensions about inflation have led to speculation that interest rates will remain elevated for an extended period. Bond yields surged across Europe, with U.K. gilts experiencing a notable spike after a record-high wage growth spurred worries about inflationary pressures. Real estate and insurance stocks underperformed on Tuesday, while retail stocks gained ground. In corporate news, Marks and Spencer Group Plc (MKS.LN) soared over +6% after the retailer lifted its profit forecast.
U.K.’s Average Earnings Index +Bonus, U.K.’s Claimant Count Change, U.K.’s Employment Change 3M/3M, U.K.’s Unemployment Rate, Germany’s ZEW Economic Sentiment, and Eurozone’s ZEW Economic Sentiment data were released today.

Asian stock markets today closed mixed. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -0.07%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.56%.
China’s Shanghai Composite today closed lower even after the central bank unexpectedly cut a key interest rate to bolster growth, following the latest data indicating a further slowdown in the country’s economic activity. Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Tuesday that China’s industrial production and retail sales growth decelerated and fell short of expectations in July. The People’s Bank of China lowered the rate on 401 billion yuan worth of one-year medium-term lending facility loans to some financial institutions by 15 basis points to 2.50%. Also, the central bank conducted a 204 billion yuan injection through seven-day reverse repos while cutting borrowing costs by 10 basis points to 1.80%. Meanwhile, the yuan declined to the weakest level since November, and China’s government bonds experienced a rally following the central bank’s decision to lower interest rates.
“The weak dataset continues to paint a bearish picture of China after the Politburo meeting. Most investors are in wait-and-see mode, only willing to allocate tactically to China on expectations of stimulus,” said UBS analysts in a note.
The Chinese July Industrial Production stood at +3.7% y/y, weaker than expectations of +4.4% y/y.
The Chinese July Retail Sales came in at +2.5% y/y, weaker than expectations of +4.5% y/y.
The Chinese July Fixed Asset Investment arrived at +3.4% y/y, weaker than expectations of +3.8% y/y.
The Chinese July Unemployment Rate was at 5.3%, in line with expectations.
At the same time, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher today, tracking Wall Street’s firm overnight finish, and market sentiment was additionally lifted by stronger-than-expected economic growth data. According to government data released on Tuesday, Japan’s economy expanded for a third consecutive quarter in April-June, as robust exports countered the impact of a decelerating post-COVID recovery in consumption. In corporate news, Japan Post Holdings climbed over +4% after the conglomerate of banks and insurance businesses revealed plans to repurchase up to 8.4% of its own shares, totaling 300 billion yen. At the same time, Dentsu Group plunged more than -7% after the advertising firm slashed its full-year net profit guidance. The Nikkei Volatility, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -4.31% to 18.85.
The Japanese GDP has been reported at +1.5% q/q and +6.0% y/y in the second quarter, stronger than expectations of +0.8% q/q and +3.1% y/y.
The Japanese June Industrial Production came in at +2.4% m/m, stronger than expectations of +2.0% m/m.

1351.0,2013-07-08 00:00:00 UTC,July 8: Earnings in the Limelight - Economic Highlights,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/july-8%3A-earnings-in-the-limelight-economic-highlights-2013-07-08,,,"Friday's strong jobs report shed a positive light on the labor market and likely increased the odds of Fed 'tapering' in the coming months. The bond market's move towards pricing in such an outcome has thankfully not become a problem for the stock market, at least not yet. We will know more later this week as minutes of the last FOMC meeting get released. But at this stage, the stock market is taking the 100 basis point jump in benchmark yields since early May in the stride.
Thankfully for us, the focus shifts from the Fed this week to the 2013 Q2 earnings season with the earnings reports from Alcoa ( AA ) later today and Yum Brands ( YUM ), J.P. Morgan ( JPM ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC ) later this week. Expectations remain low enough that companies wouldn't face much difficulty coming ahead of them. About two-thirds of companies beat earnings expectations in a typical quarter any way and there is no reason to think that the Q2 earnings season will be any different. My sense is that earnings growth and earnings surprises in the Q2 reporting cycle would be along the lines of what we saw in Q1.
Current expectations are for +0.4% growth in total earnings in Q2, down from +3.9% in early April, while total S&P 500 earnings increased by +2.8% in Q1. Nine of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to show negative earnings growth in Q2. The growth picture in is even more underwhelming when Finance is excluded from the data. Outside of Finance, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be down -3.2% in Q2.
But even more significant than growth rates and surprises will be guidance. Guidance is always important, but it will likely be far more important this time around given the elevated expectations for the second half of the year. Total earnings are expected to be up +5.1% in 2013 Q3 and by +11.7% in Q4, giving us a second-half growth pace of +9.2% from the same period the year before, which comes after +2.7% earnings growth in the first half. Importantly, the growth expectations for the second half are not due to easy comparisons - the level of total earnings expected in 2013 Q3 and Q4 represent new all-time high quarterly records.
My sense is that estimates need to come down in a big way. The market hasn't cared much in the recent past about negative revisions as aggregate earnings estimates have been coming down for over a year now. But if we are entering a post-QE world, as I believe we are, then it will likely be difficult to overlook negative earnings estimate revisions going forward. How the market responds to negative guidance over and the resulting negative revisions will tell us a lot about what to expect going forward.

4381.0,2021-06-28 00:00:00 UTC,Why American Airlines Stock Is Down Today,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-american-airlines-stock-is-down-today-2021-06-28,,,"What happened
International-focused airlines were under pressure on Monday due to new restrictions imposed by countries trying to fight the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Shares of American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) led the decline, down as much as 5% in midday trading.
So what
After a miserable 2020, airlines have rebounded nicely so far this year as vaccines have gained traction and travelers have returned to the skies. But for the most part, it has been a domestic recovery, and more-lucrative international travel remains muted.
Image source: American Airlines.
Fresh developments in fighting the pandemic suggest we will not see a return of robust international travel anytime soon. Parts of Australia have begun a two-week lockdown as cases of the so-called Delta variant of the virus have increased, and in Europe a number of countries are taking steps to limit international travel in response to the threat.
In good times, full-service airlines including American, United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) generate a significant portion of their profits from international travel. And even as progress is made in the U.S., the industry is going to suffer some until there is again unfettered travel around the globe.
Now what
The new virus threats are compounding an already murky future for the airlines, with American and others also facing pilot shortages and other staffing issues. These big companies tried to be conservative last year when cutting personnel in response to the outbreak, but are now struggling to adequately staff a recovery.
Shares of American have doubled from spring 2020 lows, and it does seem clear that the worst is now over for an industry hard hit by the pandemic. But the news flow Monday is a reminder that it isn't all clear skies ahead, and that there is likely a limit to how high these shares can fly in the near term. The stocks are selling off as a result.

4118.0,2021-10-14 00:00:00 UTC,Is American Airlines Stock A Buy After Recent Dip?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-american-airlines-stock-a-buy-after-recent-dip-2021-10-14,,,"As new infections decline, travel and entertainment stocks observe an uptick on anticipation of quick demand recovery in the coming months. However, airline stocks have been on a decline in the past week including American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL) over concerns of rising operational costs majorly due to high benchmark prices. Despite strong domestic travel demand, AAL stock is likely to trade sideways in the coming month as indicated in our interactive dashboard, American Airlines Stock Price Forecast. The company plans to repay debt from excess operating cash in the next few years, but cost pressure is a headwind to the strategic plan. Currently, AAL’s net debt of $20 billion is sizably higher than its $13 billion market capitalization, as interest expense weighs on shareholder returns.
MACHINE LEARNING ENGINE – try it yourself:
IF AAL stock moved by -5% over five trading days, THEN over the next twenty-one trading days, AAL stock moves an average of 1.3 percent, with a 52.6% probability of a positive return over this period.
Some Fun Scenarios, FAQs & Making Sense of American Airlines Stock Movements:
Q1: Is the price forecast for American Airlines stock higher after a drop?
Answer:
Answer:
Consider two situations,
Case 1: American Airlines stock drops by -5% or more in a week
Case 2: American Airlines stock rises by 5% or more in a week
Is the price forecast for American Airlines stock higher over the subsequent month after Case 1 or Case 2?
AAL stock fares better after Case 1, with an expected return of 1.2% over the next month (21 trading days) under Case 1 (where the stock has just suffered a 5% loss over the previous week), versus, an expected return of 0.2% for Case 2. This implies a price forecast of $20.32 in Case 1 and a figure of $20.10 in Case 2 using AAL market price of $20.07 on 10/11/2021.
In comparison, the S&P 500 has an expected return of 3.1% over the next 21 trading days under Case 1, and an expected return of just 0.5% for Case 2 as detailed in our dashboard that details the expected return for the S&P 500 after a rise or drop.
Try the Trefis machine learning engine above to see for yourself how the forecast for American Airlines stock is likely to changes after any specific gain or loss over a period.
Question 2: Does patience pay?
Answer:
If you buy and hold American Airlines stock, the expectation is over time the near-term fluctuations will cancel out, and the long-term positive trend will favor you – at least if the company is otherwise strong.
Overall, according to data and Trefis machine learning engine’s calculations, patience absolutely pays for most stocks!
For AAL stock, the returns over the next N days after a -5% change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500:
You can try the engine to see what this table looks like for American Airlines after a larger loss over the last week, month, or quarter.
Question 3: What about the average return after a rise if you wait for a while?
Answer:
The expected return after a rise is understandably lower than after a drop as detailed in Q1. Interestingly, though, if a stock has gained over the last few days, you would do better to avoid short-term bets for most stocks.
AAL stock returns over the next N days after a 5% change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500:

626.0,2022-10-25 00:00:00 UTC,"LMEWEEK-Norsk Hydro calls for EU, US sanctions on Russian aluminium",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lmeweek-norsk-hydro-calls-for-eu-us-sanctions-on-russian-aluminium,,,"By Victoria Klesty
OSLO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Norwegian aluminium-maker Norsk Hydro NHY.OL called on Tuesday on the United States and the European Union to stop importing Russian aluminium onto their territories, its chief executive told Reuters.
About half of Europe's aluminium production has been shut down as a result of a surge in energy costs since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while Russian output has been unaffected.
Russia's Rusal RUAL.MM, 0486.HK produces around 6% of the world's aluminium. This metal has not been targeted by Western sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
But the U.S. is considering restrictions on Russian aluminium imports and the London Metal Exchange (LME), the biggest metals trade hub, is asking members if it should ban Russian material from its system.
""We want to urge sanctions in both Europe and the US,"" Hydro CEO Hilde Merete Aasheim told Reuters. ""Our European industry shuts down, while ... we see Russian production at the same level as before the invasion. So they are benefiting.""
Hydro produces most of its aluminium in Europe, Qatar, Brazil and Canada. It has no production in Russia and has stopped trading in Russian aluminium in the wake of the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
Producing the metal, used in the automotive, packaging, construction industries among others, is highly energy-intensive.
Without sanctions against Russian imports, the future for European production would be at risk, Aasheim said, because Europe's producers, facing soaring energy costs, would be unable to compete against Russian rivals.
""It is an energy-intensive business, and when the gas has been cut from Russia we see the effect on the power prices, so what is important over time is to get in more renewable power,"" she said.
Aasheim's comments echoed those of U.S. peer Alcoa's AA.N, which is urging the White House to block U.S. imports of the metal from Russia.
With recession looming, however, some business groups say bans on Russian aluminium would decimate European industry.

2311.0,2023-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,These 5 Magnificent Stocks Keep Driving Higher,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-5-magnificent-stocks-keep-driving-higher,,,"A mini-correction in the markets often causes a pause for reflection. So, I thought I'd take a whistle-stop look at five companies that have all outperformed the S&P 500 index in 2023 and over the previous year, not least because they all have the potential to carry on doing so. Here's why.
1. nVent Electric
The electrical connection and protection company is something of a hidden gem. Run by an all-female CEO/CFO team, nVent's (NYSE: NVT) products are an indispensable part of the electrification of everything trend in the economy. Investments in electric vehicles and charging networks, smart buildings and infrastructure, data centers, renewable energy, 5G, and industrial automation all imply an increase in electrical installations, and that means an expanded market for nVent's electrical solutions.
The company has a super record of beating expectations and raising guidance. Investors have enjoyed a 174% return over the last three years as the company's end markets have expanded while management has taken full advantage. Trading on just over 16 times next year's estimated earnings, nVent remains a good value.
2. Baker Hughes
Fossil fuels may not be the flavor of the month as policymakers seek to promote renewable energy. However, for two reasons, Baker Hughes (NASDAQ: BKR) investors won't care too much about that.
First, despite ample skepticism around oil and talk of an impending recession, the fact is the price of oil is still around $79. Baker Hughes's management believes oil majors are being disciplined in their spending, having been burned after the end of the previous boom in the oil price burst in 2014. Meanwhile, leading oil producers Saudi Arabia and Russia have both repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to cut production to support the price of oil. The environment remains constructive, and Baker Hughes recently raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance.
Second, Baker Hughes is much more than oil field services and equipment. It's gaining traction in its fast-growing LNG and new energy orders, and management looks to generate further cost cuts on top of the $150 million planned as part of its restructuring program.
All told, the stock remains an excellent way to get some exposure to energy in your portfolio.
3. AAR Corp
With a market cap of just over $2 billion, AAR Corp (NYSE: AIR) isn't a household name. However, the customers it serves are very high-profile. AAR is a provider of aviation services (parts supply, maintenance, repair and engineering (MRO), and integrated solutions to some of the world's leading airlines (including United Airlines, Southwest, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines), cargo airlines (including DHL and FedEx), and government customers including the U.S. Air Force and U.K. Ministry of Defense.
As such, it's an investment in the ongoing recovery in commercial air travel. In addition, the problems Boeing and Airbus have had with delivering airplanes in recent years mean airlines have extended their existing fleets, and older planes tend to need more servicing and parts.
Moreover, the acquisition of aircraft MRO and airline fleet management software company Trax adds high-margin recurring revenue to AAR's sales mix while opening up opportunities to cross-sell AAR's products and services to Trax's customer base. Wall Street analysts have AAR growing revenue at an 8.8% annual rate for the next couple of years, with margin expansion leading to a 16% annual increase in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and good long-term growth prospects to follow.
4. ON Semiconductor
This company offers many things to different investors. For example, technology-focused investors are excited about ON Semiconductor's (NASDAQ: ON) silicon carbide technology. Industrial-focused investors are very interested in the company's focus on growing its intelligent power and sensing technology in key end markets like automotive (with a heavy focus on electric vehicles, or EVs) and industrial automation.
These end markets definitely make ON Semiconductor not the usual semiconductor conductor with heavy exposure to highly cyclical markets like consumer electronics.
The growth in EVs and industrial automation not only affords the company exciting secular growth markets but also offers an opportunity to expand revenue as these technologies use substantially more ON Semiconductor content.
Trading on less than 18 times earnings and with excellent long-term growth prospects, ON Semiconductor is an exciting stock to play some powerful secular growth trends.
5. Hexcel
Finally, advanced composite materials company Hexcel (NYSE: HXL) is an investment in the ongoing ramp in airplane production at Boeing and Airbus and the growing use of composite materials in airplane construction. The airplane manufacturers have multiyear backlogs in place and are aggressively ramping production as the commercial aerospace recovery continues and supply chain bottlenecks ease.
Meanwhile, there's little doubt that newer airplanes will increasingly contain more composite content, not least because Boeing's CEO believes they are an integral part of future airplane development.
As such, while Hexcel is hardly a cheap stock based on a valuation of 37 times this year's estimated earnings, it has high visibility into its future earnings thanks to the backlogs at Boeing and Airbus, and its long-term growth looks assured.

About Dashan Huang: Dashan Huang is an Assistant Professor of Finance at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business at Singapore Management University. His paper ""Twin Momentum"" looked at combining traditional price momentum with improving fundamentals to generate market outperformance. In the paper, he identified seven fundamental variables (earnings, return on equity, return on assets, accrual operating profitability to equity, cash operating profitability to assets, gross profit to assets and net payout ratio) that he combined into a single fundamental momentum measure. He showed that stocks in the top 20% of the universe according to that measure outperformed the market going forward. When he combined that measure with price momentum, he was able to double its outperformance.

The DJIA soared roughly 275 points on the session, overcoming its 10-day trendline in the process. Technically, the Dow could find support at the 10K level, with short-term support emerging near 9,900 should selling pressure reemerge. Resistance lingers overhead at 10,200, where the venerable average's 10-week moving average resides. As for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), the broad-market index closed a hair above 1,060 yesterday, and could find support in the area, with 1,040 providing a backstop should the bears regain control today. Overhead, the SPX is facing resistance near 1,080, which is home to its declining 10-week trendline. Heading into the open, Wall Street appears to still be digesting Wednesday's impressive rally, as futures on the DJIA and SPX are trading essentially flat compared to fair value. Finally, the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) retreated from the round-number 30 level yesterday, breaching former support in the 27-28 region. A continued advance from the SPX could send the VIX down for a test of its June lows near the 23-24 area.

The figure significantly jumped from earnings of 8 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.

Revenues of $1.9 billion increased 24% on a reported basis and 31% on FX neutral basis, respectively, year over year. The top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87 billion.

The year-over-year increase was driven by a continuous improvement in Nights and Experiences Booked. Also, growth in Average Daily Rates and Gross Booking Value (GBV) remained a tailwind.

Growing gross nights booked owing to solid momentum across high-density urban areas, remained a positive. Increasing guest demand and a continuous recovery in cross-border travel aided the quarterly performance.
Quarterly Details
Nights and Experiences Booked were 88.2 million, increasing 20% on a year-over-year basis. The metric was driven by strong performances in all regions, especially Asia Pacific.

GBV amounted to $13.5 billion, which rose 20% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.

GBV per Night and Experience Booked (or Average Daily Rates) was $152.8, down 1% year over year.

In terms of trip length, the category of long-term stays of 28 days or more which accounted for 21% of overall gross nights booked, remained a positive. Further, 46% of gross nights booked came from stays of at least seven nights.

In the reported quarter, gross nights booked in high-density urban areas represented 51% of overall gross nights booked.

Cross-border travel for the fourth quarter accounted for 44% of total gross nights booked, downfrom 49% in the same quarter last year.

WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Several public advocacy groups on Thursday called on U.S. regulators to block a bid by budget carriers Frontier Group Holdings ULCC.O and Spirit Airlines Inc SAVE.N to create the fifth-largest U.S. airline, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Public Citizen, Fight for the Future, the American Economic Liberties Project and other six groups said in a letter to the Transportation and Justice Departments that a merger between the ultra-low-cost carriers ""would destroy competition in the only competitive market segment of the highly consolidated airline industry.""
The groups added: ""Travelers will pay higher prices for fewer and lower quality options, workers will lose their jobs, and smaller firms will be muscled out of a once-competitive market segment.""
The carriers did not immediately comment.
Separately, eight progressive lawmakers including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ben Ray Lujan and Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote U.S. regulators raising concerns about the airline deal valued at $6.6 billion saying the ""resulting Spirit-Frontier carrier could hurt consumers in numerous ways, consolidating market power for the airlines and reducing choices for travelers.""
The Justice Department did not immediately comment. The Transportation Department said it would respond to the lawmakers, adding the ""administration is committed to protecting competition and consumer protection across a wide range of industries.""
The proposed merger comes as the U.S. airline industry is grappling with volatility in travel due to COVID-19. At the same time, costs are soaring on a combination of sharply higher fuel prices and rising wages.
The merger, which is expected to close in the second half of 2022, is projected to result in synergies of $500 million annually, mainly through operational savings.
The companies pledged to avoid job losses and add 10,000 direct jobs by 2026 and say it would deliver $1 billion in annual consumer savings and offer more than 1,000 daily flights to over 145 destinations.
The DOJ has filed an antitrust lawsuit against American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O and JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O over their partnership, alleging it would lead to higher fares in busy Northeastern U.S. airports.

318.0,2022-12-12 00:00:00 UTC,Vishay's (VSH) Launch of New Modules Expands Diodes Offerings,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vishays-vsh-launch-of-new-modules-expands-diodes-offerings,,,"Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. VSH is leaving no stone unturned to expand its discrete offerings to bolster its presence in the booming semiconductor industry.

The unveiling of three new series of 130 A to 300 A three-phase bridge power modules in the ultra-compact MTC package by the company is a testament to the same.

New power modules — 130 A VS-131MT…C, 160 A VS-161MT…C and 300 A VS-301MT…C — feature blocking voltages of 1600 V and 1800 V. They also offer 3600 VRMS isolation voltage and low forward voltages down to 1.54 V.

Further, these modules offer rugged design while their highly conductive MTC package delivers excellent thermal behavior, which makes them ideal for line-frequency input rectification in welding machines, switch mode power supplies, plasma cutting, battery chargers and motor control.

With all these features and benefits, Vishay is likely to gain strong traction in heavy-duty industrial applications.

Also, the latest move adds strength to the company’s diodes product line.
Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. Price and Consensus
  Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. Quote
 Growth Prospects
The latest move expands Vishay’s diode offerings, which have become an integral part of its discrete semiconductor business.

In third-quarter 2022, diodes generated revenues of $209 million (23% of total revenues), up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter’s level.

The company’s deepening focus on its semiconductor business as well as its strong product line is likely to continue aiding its financial performance in the days ahead.

This in turn is likely to aid it in winning investors’ confidence in the near term.

Vishay has gained 1% on a year-to-date basis compared with the industry’s decline of 20.6%.

Moreover, we believe that expanding diodes offerings would continue to aid Vishay in expanding its presence in the global diodes market, which, per a report from Mordor Intelligence, is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% between 2020 and 2027.
Expanding Product Portfolio
The latest launch added strength to its overall product portfolio.

Apart from the latest move, Vishay recently introduced a linear optocoupler - VOA300, which is an automotive-grade device offering an industry-high isolation voltage of 5300 Vrms.

Further, Vishay recently acquired MaxPower Semiconductor, a fabless power semiconductor provider. The acquisition helped Vishay enhance its MOSFET product offerings.

Vishay also launched four FRED Pt Gen 5 600 V Hyperfast rectifiers to strengthen its discrete semiconductor portfolio.

VSH also unveiled three inductors designed to save board space and increase efficiency in IoT devices and portable electronics.

Additionally, Vishay’s launch of 15 Hyperfast and Ultrafast rectifiers remains noteworthy. Also, the introduction of its two short-wavelength ultraviolet-emitting diodes, namely VLMU35CR40-275-120 and VLMU35CR41-275-120, in a ceramic and quartz-based package is a positive.

We believe that these endeavors will continue to shape Vishay’s growth trajectory and sustain momentum in its various end markets.
Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider
Currently, Vishay carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Investors interested in the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector can consider some better-ranked stocks like Asure Software ASUR, Agilent Technologies A and AMETEK AME. While Asure Software sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Agilent Technologies and AMETEK carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Asure Software has lost 10.9% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for ASUR is currently projected at 23%.

Agilent Technologies has lost 7.8% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for A is currently projected at 10%.

AMETEK has lost 5.7% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for AME is currently projected at 9.7%.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2826.0,2023-03-09 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines pilots union sets April strike authorization vote,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-pilots-union-sets-april-strike-authorization-vote,,,"By Allison Lampert
March 9 (Reuters) - The union representing American Airlines AAL.O pilots will take a strike authorization vote in April, underscoring a broader push by North American pilots to make gains on salary and working conditions as air traffic increases sharply.
The vote announced by the union on Thursday will conclude on April 30 and follows Delta Air Lines DAL.N pilots ratifying a new contract earlier this month that includes $7 billion in cumulative increases in pay and benefits over four years.
The deal is widely seen to be a benchmark for contract negotiations at rival U.S. carriers and has also rallied pilots seeking higher pay at Air Canada.
""Management must understand that they need to demonstrate the same level of commitment to bargaining that other airline management teams have shown in recent months,"" the Allied Pilots Association said in a bulletin to members.
Representatives of American Airlines were not immediately available to comment.
Earlier this week American's chief executive said the carrier is prepared to match the pay rates and profit-sharing formula that rival Delta provided in its new contract.
Some airline executives are concerned that hefty pilot pay raises will inflate fixed costs and make it tougher to repair debt-laden balance sheets.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Doug Parker has had enough. The American Airlines chief executive is stepping down https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Announces-Leadership-Succession-Plan-CORP-EXEC-12/default.aspx and handing the controls to current President Robert Isom. After two decades guiding airlines through one crisis after another, he can hardly be blamed for bailing out. But he’s leaving American’s shareholders in the lurch.
Parker took over in 2013 as American merged with US Airways, where he was serving as CEO. He had already had a long aviation career, including piloting American West Airlines through the trauma of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Since he started at American, shares have significantly underperformed peers including Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines.
The past 22 months have arguably been even more grueling. American’s shares are down a third since last January, in line with rival Delta but lagging budget-focused Southwest. More worrying is the $24 billion of net debt now sitting in the hold. At some 7 times next year’s estimated EBITDA, according to Refinitiv, that’s going to take some paying off https://www.breakingviews.com/considered-view/still-time-to-make-u-s-airlines-pay-their-way/?bved=NDI%3D&bvshr=MTgxNjM2. Parker can presumably look forward to a comfortable retirement package. His shareholders have no such luxury. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)

1126.0,2020-08-14 00:00:00 UTC,COLUMN-Politics trumps aluminium as U.S. reimposes Canadian tariffs: Andy Home,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/column-politics-trumps-aluminium-as-u.s.-reimposes-canadian-tariffs%3A-andy-home-2020-08-14,,,"By Andy Home
LONDON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The United States will reinstate tariffs on imports of Canadian primary aluminium this weekend.
This is not unexpected despite a ferocious rearguard lobbying campaign by a broad spectrum of U.S. consumers.
Aluminium has been a pillar of the Trump Administration's ""America First"" trade agenda from the start. Along with steel it was early designated a sector critical for national security, leading to the imposition of 10% tariffs on imports in 2018.
Unfortunately, the pillar is wobbling.
Alcoa AA.N is curtailing its Ferndale smelter in the state of Washington, reducing the number of domestic operating plants to six. Century Aluminum CENX.O, which operates three smelters and has led the lobbying charge against Canadian imports, has just announced a quarterly loss of $26.9m.
Another smelter casualty in a U.S. election year would be a public relations disaster.
However, Canada is being made the scapegoat for market forces determined first and foremost by China, the world's largest producer and exporter of aluminium.
This trade skirmish between Western allies reinforces the sense of missed opportunity in tackling China's growing dominance of the global supply chain.
BATTLE OF THE SURGE
The reimposition of tariffs on Canadian primary unalloyed aluminium is down to what President Trump described as ""a surge"" of imports since Canada was exempted in May last year.
Pro- and anti-tariff lobbyists have waged statistical war over this apparent ""surge"".
Canada has historically been the largest supplier of primary aluminium to the U.S. market with volumes fluctuating significantly between 2.00 and 2.50 million tonnes over the last five years.
This historical volatility allows both sides to use the same data to come up with diametrically different conclusions.
But even if there has been a ""surge"" of imports in recent months, it's been driven by market rather than tariff forces.
Demand imploded in the United States in the first half of 2020 as lockdowns and quarantine measures hit both automotive and aerospace sectors.
Aluminium smelters responded by maintaining throughput but switching production from customer-tailored alloys to ""commodity-grade"" metal. This can be sold more easily to the merchant market or to the market of last resort, namely the London Metal Exchange (LME).
The last global crisis of 2009 saw huge amounts of metal migrate towards LME warehouses in Detroit.
A similar pattern is emerging this time. Although LME warehouses in Detroit currently hold no warranted metal, aluminium is accumulating in the statistical shadows.
The LME's new report on shadow stocks shows 120,000 tonnes sitting in Detroit at the end of June, up from 67,000 tonnes at the end of March. That's metal that is being stored under contracts referencing LME delivery. There may be still more outside of that reporting net.
There are no LME delivery locations in Canada and it is quite possible that some of the import ""surge"" has simply been metal heading for exchange storage and financing rather than competing with U.S. production.
It's telling that the Trump Administration has slapped tariffs back only on unalloyed metal, presumably because alloy imports have fallen during the demand meltdown.
US CONSUMERS PAY THE PRICE
The market has been quick to price in the Canadian tariff move.
U.S. consumers pay both the basis LME price and a premium for Midwest delivery. The latter, traded on the CME as an index linked to S&P Global Platts' assessment of the domestic market AUPc1, has surged from 8 cents per lb in May to over 15 cents.
This is pretty much the level identified by analysts at Citi as the required price to incentivise imports to the U.S. domestic market, which remains, tariffs or no tariffs, dependent on flows of both primary aluminium and products. (""The Aluminium Book: A New Era for Aluminium"", Aug 2, 2020).
U.S. consumers have to absorb this higher price, whether they buy tariffed or tariff-free metal. They even pay it if they use domestically-sourced scrap, as can manufacturers have discovered to their cost.
This is the way tariffs work. Any producer of any commodity will seek the highest potential price afforded by trade restrictions.
As a grouping of U.S. users ranging from the Beer Institute to the National Association of Trailer Manufacturers noted in a July 20 letter to the White House, ""this money goes to the seller, not the Treasury, and payment of the premium is non-negotiable.""
NO VIABLE STRATEGY
It's a price worth paying, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA), a vocal proponent of Trump's ""America First"" trade policies.
The CPA concedes that China's huge flow of exports has been the root problem for U.S. producers in recent years but no-one has come up with ""a viable strategy for reducing China's oversupply,"" according to CPA chief economist Jeff Ferry, writing in support of renewed Canadian tariffs.
In truth, though, the United States has missed two prime opportunities to tackle China's over-production.
The previous administration's parting shot on the issue was a full-blooded complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO), which could have formed the platform for the sort of multilateral pressure that led to China cutting 150 million tonnes of steel production capacity.
However, this administration doesn't do the WTO or anything associated with President Barack Obama.
The second opportunity came from the Commerce Department's landmark January 2018 report finding that aluminium was critical to national security and that import restrictions were needed.
One option suggested was penal tariffs of 23.6% on imports from China, potential transhipment countries Hong Kong and Vietnam, as well as Russia and Venezuela.
The U.S. could have directed its considerable trade firepower at the source of the global oversupply problem.
Rather, President Trump chose the path of blanket tariffs at 10%, rounding up Commerce's suggested 7.7% duty and paving the way for the sort of friendly-fire dispute currently playing out with Canada.
Canada has already vowed to respond in kind to the reimposition of tariffs on its exports, which is how trade restrictions tend to multiply.
Both U.S. and European aluminium sectors are launching ever more anti-dumping cases against specific aluminium products as they play whack-a-mole with Chinese exports.
The European Union has just initiated a probe into imports of Chinese flat-rolled products.
The U.S. Commerce Department last week determined in favour of countervailing duties on imports of alloy sheet from Bahrain, Brazil, India and Turkey. This is product in all likelihood displaced by Chinese exports in other regional markets.
What's missing is a ""viable strategy"".
A change of administration might just possibly give the United States a third opportunity to tackle China head-on about its aluminium dominance.
But time is running out.
China's huge and still-growing aluminium smelter sector broke another monthly production record in July.

5 Broker-Friendly Stocks to Watch Despite Market Mayhem
Mounting inflation in the United States is a key concern, implying that market volatility is still rampant. To tame the red-hot inflation, the Fed has hiked interest rates 300 basis points so far this year.  The central bank further vowed to raise interest rates to drag down inflation to its 2% target at best by 2025. Soaring interest rates will continue to increase the cost of borrowing, which in turn, will persistently affect consumer spending. In fact, the Fed also warned of economic hardship going forward.
Rising energy and food prices apart, supply-chain disruptions and the resultant supply-demand imbalance are aggravating the stock market volatility. This uncertainty caused the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite — to shed 8.8%, 9.3% and 10.5% of their value, respectively, in September.
However, this gloomy scenario does not mean that investors should dodge stocks. In fact, broker-friendly stocks like American Airlines, CVR Energy, C.H. Robinson, Ford Motor Co. and DISH Network Corp. are worth keeping on one's radar for healthy returns despite this market bloodbath.
Why Broker Advice is the Need of the Hour
Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), embark on thorough research of the stocks under their coverage. They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations. Since brokers indulge in extensive research, the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise.
Therefore, the brokers' opinion can be a valuable guide for investors. Thus, adhering to brokers' well-researched information is of paramount importance, particularly in uncertain times such as the present scenario. This is because it is next to impossible for individual investors to keep track of the market nuances amid such economic upheavals and design a winning basket of stocks.
One of the well-accepted investment strategies is to maintain a diversified portfolio to generate handsome returns, irrespective of the market conditions. For instance, in the face of extremely low oil prices, analysts adopt a bullish stance on airline stocks and raise estimates. Naturally, adding such stocks to one's portfolio amid an unpredictable situation might prove to be a winning strategy.
To take care of the earnings performance, we designed a screen based on improving broker recommendations and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.
Do Not Ignore the Top Line
However, designing a strategy based solely on the bottom line is unlikely to lead to a winning approach. Actually, according to many market watchers, a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance. To address top-line concerns, we included in our screen the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.
Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:
American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.
Over the past 60 days, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 8.42% upward. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high-value transportation fuels. CVI is also a producer of ammonia and urea ammonia nitrate fertilizers. CVI's petroleum business includes full-coking sour crude refinery in Coffeyville, KS. Its efforts to reward its shareholders underline its strong financial position. The robust Nitrogen Fertilizer unit is supporting growth.
CVR Energy, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 20.21% over the past 60 days. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. 
C.H. Robinson Worldwide, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, operates as an asset-light logistics player. The improving freight scenario in the United States is aiding this Minnesota-based freight broker. Efforts to control costs also bode well. Measures to reward CHRW's shareholders instill further confidence in the stock.
C.H. Robinson has an encouraging earnings track record. The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining one). CHRW has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 2.09% upward over the past 60 days.
Ford's vehicle line-up, supported by F-series trucks, Maverick pickup and SUV models, including Escape, Explorer, Expedition, EcoSport and Edge is impressive. F's North America market, which accounts for the bulk of total automotive revenues, is set to drive solid results.
Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. F has witnessed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings being revised 0.5% upward over the past 60 days.
DISH Network's focus on acquiring and retaining subscribers, who will be profitable in the long term, is commendable and is expected to drive growth. DISH created an extensive portfolio of spectrum, the most important component of wireless networks.
At DISH, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining two). The average beat is 6%. DISH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

1629.0,2012-04-13 00:00:00 UTC,"Stock Market News for April 13, 2012 - Market News",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-news-for-april-13-2012-market-news-2012-04-13,,,"Improving growth prospects in the world's second-largest economy, China, and positive developments from the European region drove the markets significantly higher, negating much of week's losses so far. Global cues also overshadowed a rise in weekly jobless claims, ensuring benchmarks' second-straight day of gains. Meanwhile, after investors waited for Google's results through the trading session, the tech-giant delivered encouraging numbers after the closing bell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) soared 181.19 points or 1.4% to close at 12,986.58. The Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) also jumped 1.4% and finished yesterday's trading session at 1,387.57. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index surged 1.3% and climbed up to 3,055.55. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index slumped, losing 14.1% and closed at 17.20. Consolidated volumes on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were 6.14 billion shares, lower than last year's daily average of 7.84 billion. Advancing stocks completely outshined the decliners on the NYSE; as for 80% of the stocks that gained, a mere 17% stocks traded lower. The remaining 3% stocks were left unchanged.
Yesterday's gains have now pushed benchmarks closer to their key levels. Losses suffered since last week had dragged the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq below their key levels of 13, 000, 1,400 and 3, 000, respectively. While the &P 500 was the first to drop below its key level last Wednesday, dismal nonfarm payroll data released last Friday had dragged the blue-chip index below 13, 000 earlier this week on Monday. A day later, Nasdaq dropped below 3, 000 following reports of surging borrowing costs in Spain and Italy and less-than-expected imports in China However, Nasdaq's stay below 3, 000 was short-lived and it soon rebounded over that level. The Dow and S&P 500 are yet to catch up with their individual key levels, but they are now shy only by 13.42 and 12.43 points, respectively. Additionally, the S&P 500 is now back over its 50-day moving average.
Incidentally, while concerns from Europe and China had dented the markets over the past few trading sessions, positive developments from the same regions have now helped markets climb higher. Firstly, investors had a lot to cheer about following positive developments in Europe. Luckily yesterday, Italy witnessed a successful bond auction as the nation sold $6.4 billion of government bonds. Spanish bond-yields also showed declining trends and have dropped to 5.8%.
Meanwhile, with the GDP report due late at night, rumors of China's first-quarter GDP coming in better-than-expected at 9% compared with prior estimates of 8.4%, boosted the benchmarks through the trading session. Strong growth in the world's second-largest economy is certainly good news for the global financial arena. Therefore, there will surely be a lot to cheer about if the region finally comes out with robust GDP numbers.
Investors also negated dismal domestic labor data, as they remained occupied with global events. The U.S. Department of Labor reported that the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims jumped 13,000 to 380,000, for the week ending April 7, up from previous week's revised figure of 367,000. The jump in initial claims was also significantly higher than consensus estimates of initial claims clocking up a figure of 357, 000.
Coming to sectoral stocks, materials put up a good performance and the Materials Select Sector SPDR ( XLB ) gained 2.7%. Stocks including E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (NYSE: DD ), Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX ), Newmont Mining Corp. (NYSE: NEM ), Southern Copper Corp. (NYSE: SCCO ) and Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. (NYSE: ANR ) soared 1.9%, 5.9%, 3.2%, 5.5% and 9.9%, respectively.
Meanwhile, with the earnings season already getting an unofficial kick-start with Alcoa, Inc. (NYSE: AA ) reporting encouraging figures on Tuesday, it was Google Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOG ) results that investors were waiting for and the tech giant did not disappoint. On Friday, financial bellwethers JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ) and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC ) will report their results after the closing bell.

2331.0,2023-08-18 00:00:00 UTC,Frontline (FRO) to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/frontline-fro-to-post-q2-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-offing,,,"Frontline Ltd. FRO is scheduled to release second-quarter 2023 earnings on Aug 24. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has been revised 13.9% upward to 90 cents per share over the past 60 days.
Against this backdrop, let’s delve into the factors that might have impacted Frontline’s June-quarter performance.
FRO’s performance in the second quarter is expected to have been affected by supply-chain disruptions. High operating expenses due to increased average number of vessels in its fleet and fuel expenses are likely to have hurt the bottom line. Even though fuel price has come down from the highs witnessed earlier, it still remains at an elevated level.
However, high tanker rates are likely to have aided the top-line performance. Moreover, with the resumption of economic activities, world trade gained pace, which should aid second-quarter results of shipping stocks like Frontline. This is because the shipping industry is responsible for transporting several goods involved in world trade.
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Frontline this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of a positive surprise. However, that is not the case here.
Earnings ESP: Frontline has an Earnings ESP of -12.85% (the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at 78 cents per share, 12 cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Zacks Rank: Frontline carries a Zacks Rank # 3 currently.
Q2 Performance of Some Other Transportation Companies
American Airlines’ AAL second-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.92 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58. AAL’s results were aided by lower costs and higher revenues.
Operating revenues of $14,055 million rose 4.7% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,736.3 million.
Passenger revenues, accounting for 92.3% of the top line, increased to $12,978 million from $12,223 million a year ago. This was driven by strong air-travel demand, mainly on the domestic front.
Demand was particularly strong in June on the back of growth in close-in bookings. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. 
United Airlines UAL reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $5.03, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99 and surging more than 100% year over year. UAL currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Operating revenues of $14,178 million outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,927.1 million. UAL’s revenues climbed 17.1% year over year due to upbeat air-travel demand. The uptick was driven by a 20.1% rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 91.7% of the top line) to $13,002 million. Nearly 42 million passengers traveled on UAL flights in the second quarter.

565.0,2023-01-23 00:00:00 UTC,3 Stocks to Avoid This Week,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-stocks-to-avoid-this-week-62,,,"Wall Street moved slightly lower during the third trading week of 2023. My ""three stocks to avoid,"" which I thought were going to lose to the market in the past week -- Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: BBBY), Alcoa (NYSE: AA), and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) -- plunged 8%, dipped 7%, and closed flat, respectively, averaging out to a 5% decline.
The S&P 500 moved in the other direction, increasing 0.7% for the holiday-abridged week. It was close, but I was right. I have been correct in 43 of the past 66 weeks, or 65% of the time.
Let's turn our attention to the week ahead. I see Bed Bath & Beyond, D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI), and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) as stocks you might want to consider steering clear of this week. Let's go over my near-term concerns with all three investments.
Image source: Getty Images.
1. Bed Bath & Beyond
Singling out Bed Bath & Beyond for a second week is a dangerous game. I'm fairly confident where this story will end, but there will be short squeezes and other spikes along the way. The housewares retailer is in trouble. Sales growth is negative for the chain's fifth consecutive fiscal year, and losses are widening.
Remember the early days of the pandemic, when folks invested heavily in their homes to make themselves more comfortable during lockdown? Bed Bath & Beyond sales plummeted 17% that fiscal year, the first of what will be three straight years of double-digit declines on the top line. Shoppers had abandoned the chain before the pandemic, too, even as the economy and real estate market were heading in the right direction.
Bed Bath & Beyond is in bad shape. Its heavy debt load gives it not much to play with now. The investment will be volatile, and while that's par for the course for meme stocks, this is one where the best-case bullish scenario is difficult to spell out.
2. D.R. Horton
Homebuilders have had a good run, and valuations look tempting on a trailing basis. It's also earnings season, and D.R. Horton is reporting fresh financials on Tuesday morning. I'm still putting the Texas-based developer on this list.
D.R. Horton shares enter this week just 3% below its 52-week high, but you have to wonder why that's the case. The residential builder fell short of Wall Street earnings expectations when it posted fourth-quarter results for fiscal 2022 three months ago, making it a challenging hold heading into this week's update. Analysts have also been slashing their profit targets.
Wall Street pros were eyeing net income of $13.38 a share for the new fiscal year and $14.14 a share in fiscal 2024 just three months ago. The consensus estimate is now $9.61 and $9.74, respectively. The stock may seem cheap at just less than 10 times forward earnings, but you have to wonder if the projections will keep tumbling after 28% to 31% in downward revisions over just a couple of months.
Bulls will argue that we have a shortage of homes in this country, and they're not wrong. But new digs are likely to be priced lower on contracting margins.
3. Tesla Motors
It's not just D.R. Horton checking in with what could be problematic quarterly results this week. Tesla Motors will step up with its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday afternoon.
Tesla has done a lot of things right over the years, but these next two financial updates aren't likely to impress. Tesla had to discount December deliveries -- twice -- and it still fell short of market expectations for deliveries. The first quarter is likely to squeeze margins even harder with huge price cuts on its Model Y cars.
The stock is up 23% over the past dozen days despite weak demand prompting aggressive price cuts in the U.S. and China. Investors may be looking past the short-term hiccups, but they might rethink that stance if this week'searnings callis cloudy and unsettling.
It's going to be a bumpy road for some of these investments. If you're looking for safe stocks, you aren't likely to find them in Bed Bath & Beyond, D.R. Horton, and Tesla Motors this week.

2354.0,2023-08-08 00:00:00 UTC,Expeditors (EXPD) Stock Down on Q2 Earnings & Revenue Miss,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/expeditors-expd-stock-down-on-q2-earnings-revenue-miss,,,"Expeditors International of Washington’s EXPD second-quarter 2023 earnings of $1.30 per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.34. Moreover, the bottom line plunged 42.7% year over year. Total revenues of $2,239.8 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2,878.8 million and decreased 51.3% year over year. Results were hurt by the lackluster demand scenario.
The below-par second-quarter performance naturally disappointed investors. As a result, EXPD stock declined in early trading following the earnings release.
A dip in volumes also played spoilsport. Airfreight tonnage and ocean container volumes tumbled 15% and 13% year over year, respectively. Operating income declined 51% to $278 million. Total operating expenses fell 51% to $1.99 billion.
Airfreight services revenues decreased 53% year over year to $525 million in the second quarter of 2023. Ocean freight and ocean services revenues fell 66.2% to $593.8 million. Customs brokerage and other services revenues declined 27.9% year over year to $894.8 million.
Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. Quote
Per Jeffrey S. Musser, EXPD’s president and chief executive officer, “Despite increased air capacity, shippers face uncertain demand for their products, as consumers remain cautious amidst declines in their purchasing power. In that regard, second-quarter operating conditions were very much a continuation of what we experienced in the immediately prior two quarters”.
In the reported quarter, EXPD repurchased 6 million shares at an average price of $114.61 per share. Expeditors also pays dividends of 69 cents per share on a semi-annual basis. It exited the June-end quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.69 billion compared with $2.03 billion at 2022 end.
Currently, Expeditors carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Q2 Performance of Some Other Transportation Companies
American Airlines’ AAL second-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 4 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.92 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58. AAL’s results were aided by lower costs and higher revenues.
Operating revenues of $14,055 million rose 4.7% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,736.3 million. Passenger revenues, accounting for 92.3% of the top line, increased to $12,978 million from $12,223 million a year ago. This was driven by strong air-travel demand, mainly on the domestic front.
Demand was particularly strong in June on the back of growth in close-in bookings. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 
United Airlines UAL, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1, reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $5.03, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.99 and improved more than 100% year over year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
Operating revenues of $14,178 million outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,927.1 million. UAL’s revenues climbed 17.1% year over year due to upbeat air-travel demand. The uptick was driven by a 20.1% rise in passenger revenues (accounting for 91.7% of the top line) to $13,002 million. Nearly 42 million passengers traveled on UAL flights in the second quarter.

4786.0,2021-01-21 00:00:00 UTC,Alrosa sees strong demand for diamonds in Q1 after lower sales in 2020,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alrosa-sees-strong-demand-for-diamonds-in-q1-after-lower-sales-in-2020-2021-01-21,,,"Adds details, quotes, context
MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Russian state-controlled diamond producer Alrosa ALRS.MM sees strong global demand for diamonds in the first quarter of 2021 after its sales fell by 4% to 32.1 million carats in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, it said on Thursday.
Alrosa, the world's largest producer of rough diamonds, which competes with Anglo American AAL.L unit De Beers, reduced 2020 production by 22% to 30 million carats as it suspended mining at less profitable mines.
""By the end of the year, demand for rough diamonds was strong and stable, driven by a balanced sales policy of major diamond producers seeking to meet real demand, along with a seasonal uptick in demand,"" Alrosa said.
The company along with its global peers focused on a ""price-over-volume"" strategy in 2020 to speed up the reduction of stocks in the cutting and polishing sector, the majority of which is located in India.
This sector is increasing its production now as jewellery businesses seek to replenish their inventories and due to market activity ahead of the Chinese New Year, it added.
Alrosa's 2020 sales revenue fell by 16% to $2.8 billion.
""Despite almost zero sales in the middle of 2020, Alrosa's 2020 sales look better than they could have been due to a strong fourth quarter,"" Artem Bagdasaryan, an analyst at BCS, said.
Global sales of luxury goods may show a growth of 10-20% in 2021 after their 23 percent drop in 2020, Alrosa told Reuters, citing an estimate of Bain consultancy.
If this forecast turns out to be correct, the diamond jewellery sector may show a similar dynamic, the miner said.
In mid-2020, the Russian government said it was considering buying some of Alrosa's diamonds to support it.
""At the moment, the market conditions allow us not to consider this option for the company yet. But we understand that such an option is available in case there is a need for it,"" Alrosa said.

192.0,2023-03-21 00:00:00 UTC,"US calls Tsai transit 'nothing new', urges China to not react aggressively",A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-calls-tsai-transit-nothing-new-urges-china-to-not-react-aggressively,,,"By Michael Martina and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Reuters) - Expected U.S. stopovers in coming weeks by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen are standard practice and China should not use them as a pretext for aggressive action toward the democratically governed island, a senior U.S. administration official said.
Tsai plans to transit through New York and Los Angeles as part of a trip to Central America, and sources have told Reuters that U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy intends to meet her during the California leg of her visit.
China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, has said it is ""seriously concerned"" about Tsai's travel plans.
But the senior U.S. official told reporters on a call on Monday night that every president of Taiwan had transited through the U.S., and that Tsai has done so herself six times since taking office 2016, most recently in 2019.
She had met members of Congress during all of those visits, the official added, noting that the COVID-19 pandemic had limited her travel in more recent years.
""We see no reason for Beijing to turn this transit, again, which is consistent with long-standing U.S. policy, into anything but what it is. It should not be used as a pretext to step up any aggressive activity around the Taiwan Strait,"" the official said.
The official said Washington had communicated to Beijing that Tsai's stopovers are in keeping with past precedent.
""There is nothing new from our point of view,"" the official said.
Noting that President Joe Biden hoped to speak to Chinese leader Xi Jinping soon and that Secretary of State Antony Blinken would like to reschedule a postponed trip to Beijing, the official said: ""We urge the PRC (People's Republic of China) to keep these channels of communication open.""
""In terms of contact with McCarthy's office, we offer briefings to members before engagements. We tend to do that before travel, before meetings. We've had some regular contact there,"" the official added.
Tsai's anticipated U.S. meeting with McCarthy is seen as a potential alternative to a sensitive visit by the Republican Speaker to Taiwan, a trip he has said he hopes to make.
China staged military exercises around Taiwan in August following a visit to Taipei by then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue and a major bone of contention with Washington, which maintains only unofficial ties with Taipei, but is required by U.S. law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
China believes the United States is colluding with Taiwan to challenge Beijing and giving support to those who want the island to declare formal independence.
Taiwan's government says the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island and so has no right to claim it, and that only its 23 million people can decide their future.

76.0,2023-08-03 00:00:00 UTC,Cognex Corporation (CGNX) Beats Q2 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/cognex-corporation-cgnx-beats-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates,,,"Cognex Corporation (CGNX) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.32 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.25 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.41 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 28%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $0.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.13, delivering a surprise of 44.44%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.
Cognex Corporation, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Testing Equipment industry, posted revenues of $242.51 million for the quarter ended June 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.99%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $274.63 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Cognex Corporation shares have added about 8.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 17.6%.
What's Next for Cognex Corporation?
While Cognex Corporation has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Cognex Corporation: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.29 on $248.76 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.95 on $934.45 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Testing Equipment is currently in the top 23% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
One other stock from the same industry, Agilent Technologies (A), is yet to report results for the quarter ended July 2023. The results are expected to be released on August 15.
This scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.37 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.2%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

3901.0,2022-01-03 00:00:00 UTC,"Verizon, AT&T to delay 5G deployment, averting aviation standoff",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/verizon-att-to-delay-5g-deployment-averting-aviation-standoff,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications VZ.N and AT&T Inc T.N said late on Monday they had agreed to a two-week delay in deploying C-Band wireless spectrum, averting an aviation safety standoff that threatened to disrupt flights starting this week.
The carriers had faced pressure from the White House, airlines and aviation unions to delay the deployment amid concerns about potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics like radio altimeters that could disrupt flights.
The agreement pushes back the deployment date to Jan. 19. Verizon said the delay ""promises the certainty of bringing this nation our game-changing 5G network in January."" AT&T said it agreed to the delay at the request of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
""We know aviation safety and 5G can co-exist and we are confident further collaboration and technical assessment will allay any issues,"" the company said.
Over the next two weeks, regulators, airlines and wireless carriers will look at ways of minimizing the potential impact of interference on flight operations.
Earlier on Monday, groups representing U.S. airlines, aircraft manufacturers and airports had urged the White House to intervene to delay the use by wireless carriers of C-Band spectrum for 5G, which the carriers won in an $80 billion government auction.
The delay came after the chief executives of AT&T and Verizon on Sunday had rejected a request to delay the planned Jan. 5 introduction of new 5G wireless service over aviation safety concerns but offered to temporarily adopt new safeguards.
Buttigieg and Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson had asked AT&T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg on Friday for a delay of up to two weeks.
In December, the FAA warned that interference from the planned use of 5G wireless spectrum posed an air safety risk and could result in flight diversions. But it had not yet issued formal notices that would further outline the potential scale of impact.
Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 flight attendants at 17 airlines, had said on Twitter that ""if medicine delivered to hospitals and homes is delayed"" Verizon would be responsible.
""If passengers are stranded, thank @Verizon,"" Nelson said. ""Their incentive is money. Our incentive is safety. It’s the purest form of profits over people.""
The wireless companies Sunday said they would not deploy 5G around airports for six months but rejected any broader limitation on using C-Band spectrum. That exclusion zone around airports is not as large as the FAA wants.
The Trade group Airlines for America, representing American Airlines AAL.O, FedEx FDX.N and other carriers, had asked the Federal Communications Commission to halt deployment around many airports, warning thousands of flights could be disrupted daily.

ODFL is benefiting from the strong performance of the less-than-truckload (LTL) segment. The company’s measures to reward its shareholders are encouraging.
Against this backdrop, let’s look at the factors that make this stock an attractive pick.
What Makes Old Dominion an Attractive Pick?
An Outperformer: A glimpse at the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse over the past six months. Shares of Old Dominion have gained 29.5% over the past six months, outperforming the 14.9% rise of the industry it belongs to.

Solid Rank & VGM Score: Old Dominion currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company seems to be an appropriate investment proposition at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Northward Estimate Revisions:The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Old Dominion’s first-quarter 2023 earnings has moved up 3.4% year over year. For 2023 and 2024, the company’s earnings are expected to increase 4.1% and 3.4%, year over year, respectively. 
Positive Earnings Surprise History: Old Dominion has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 8.73% in the last four quarters, on average.
Earnings Expectations: Earnings growth and stock price gains often indicate a company’s prospects. For first-quarter 2023, Old Dominion’s earnings are expected to grow 4.2% year over year.
Growth Factors: Old Dominion is benefiting from the strong performance of the LTL segment owing to improved freight conditions. In 2022, segmental revenues increased 19.3%. In 2022, LTL shipments and LTL revenue per shipment increased 0.8% and 18.3%, respectively. 
Further, ODFL’s efforts to add shareholder value are impressive. In 2022, ODFL paid dividends of $134.48 million and repurchased shares worth $1,277.21 million. ODFL’s board has raised its quarterly cash dividend by 33.3% to 40 cents per share, effective from the first quarter of 2023.
Improvement in the operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues), owing to higher revenues, is encouraging. With improved freight market conditions, a rise in LTL shipments is driving the top line.

1434.0,2013-02-07 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa Recognized in China - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-recognized-in-china-analyst-blog-2013-02-07,,,"Aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) has announced that it has received the 2013 Accessory of the Year Award in China. The company was honored in the Best Safety & Energy Savings category.
Alcoa received the award based on its contribution to China's bus manufacturing industry. The awards were sponsored by trade publications CNbuses.com and shangyongqiche.com, with support from the China Tourism News. Alcoa's award win was dedicated to three factors. The first one being its brand influence and reputation.
The second factor taken into consideration was application of Alcoa's products in the China bus market. Alcoa has a presence in China since 2004 and advanced processes and technologies, as well as high-quality products have made positive contributions to the development of China's bus manufacturing industry.
The company also expanded its presence in the country by opening a production facility in Suzhou, China, and created a full wheel manufacturing, distribution, sales and service network in China.
The third factor was Lightweighting. Alcoa's forged aluminum wheels help to lightweight the commercial vehicle industry, making it an industry leader.
Alcoa released its fourth-quarter 2012 results on Jan 8. The company swung to profit in the quarter, buoyed by one-time gains. It posted a profit (from continuing operation) of $242 million or 21 cents per share in the fourth quarter compared with a loss of $193 million or 18 cents a share reported in the year-ago quarter. The results were boosted by a gain of $178 million ($161 million post-tax) associated with a hydroelectric project asset sale.
Excluding one-time special items, Alcoa earned $64 million or 6 cents a share in the quarter, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company's midstream and downstream businesses delivered profits and its cost-cutting measures also supported the results.

2201.0,2023-10-09 00:00:00 UTC,US STOCKS-Wall Street advances as investors monitor Mideast conflict headlines,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-stocks-wall-street-advances-as-investors-monitor-mideast-conflict-headlines,,,"By Sinéad Carew and Shashwat Chauhan
Oct 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes closed higher on Monday while energy stocks rallied as investors digested the latest news about the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.
The Israeli military said it called up reservists and was imposing a total blockade of the Gaza Strip in signs it could be planning a ground assault there to defeat Hamas which launched a deadly attack over the weekend.
But late in the afternoon, a senior Hamas official said the group is open to discussions over a possible truce with Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden said he directed his team to coordinate with regional partners to warn anyone seeking to take advantage of the situation.
News of the conflict sparked an oil rally due to supply concerns. But stock indexes managed to reverse earlier declines with help of more dovish Federal Reserve official comments.
As a result investors appeared to refocus on more U.S. centric matters, John Augustine, said chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio.
""The stock market and investors are focused on two things, the economy and earnings. The U.S. economy is not slowing and earnings are expected to come out of a recession with reports starting this week,"" Augustine said.
""Those fundamentals are more powerful in the market than terrible geopolitical headlines from the weekend just as they were more powerful than a strong jobs report and worries about the Fed on Friday.""
The U.S. bond market was shut on Monday for Columbus Day, also known as Indigenous Peoples' Day.
A recent surge in U.S. Treasury yields had pressured equities. That pressure eased as gains in the iShares Core 10+ years U.S. bond Exchange Traded Fund (ETF> ILTB.K and the iShares 20+ years Treasury bond ETF TLT.O suggested that yields could fall on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Fed officials indicated that recent gains in yields on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, which directly influence financing costs for households and businesses, could steer the Fed from further hikes in its short-term policy rate. This eased some concerns among equity investors.
According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 27.35 points, or 0.63%, to end at 4,335.85 points, while the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC gained 53.90 points, or 0.40%, to 13,485.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 199.83 points, or 0.60%, to 33,607.41.
Traditional safe-haven assets remained in demand, with goldXAU= climbing, but the U.S. dollar index =USD gave up earlier gains.
Rising oil prices boosted the S&P energy .SPNY sector, making it the biggest gainer among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors.
United Airlines UAL.O, Delta Air Lines DAL.N and American Airlines AAL.Osuspended direct flights to Tel Aviv. Shares of the airlines, also hurt by rising oil prices, putting pressure on the S&P 500 Passenger Airlines index .SPLRCALI.
Defense companies had rallied after the news from Israel, with the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense index .SPLRCAERO. Big advancers included Northrop Grumman NOC.N and L3Harris Technologies LHX.N.
Exchange-traded funds exposed to Israel were selling off, with iShares MSCI Israel ETF EIS.N falling along with the ARK Israel Innovative Technology ETF IZRL.N.

4411.0,2021-06-11 00:00:00 UTC,ANALYSIS-Mines and votes: Socialist Castillo sweeps Peru's key mining regions,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysis-mines-and-votes%3A-socialist-castillo-sweeps-perus-key-mining-regions-2021-06-11,,,"By Marco Aquino
LIMA, June 11 (Reuters) - Peru's key mining regions overwhelming supported socialist Pedro Castillo, who looks on track to win the Andean country's tight presidential election and has pledged to sharply hike taxes on firms operating in the world's no. 2 copper producer.
The high support in districts where key mines are located underscores how tensions have burst through after years of conflict between mining firms and the local communities who often say they are left behind and do not share in the wealth.
In mining provinces such as Cotabambas, Espinar and Chumbivilcas, over nine out of 10 people voted for Castillo, election data show, propelling him to a narrow but sustained lead ahead of conservative rival Keiko Fujimori.
Those regions are home to major mines such as the huge Las Bambas copper mine, operated by China's MMG Ltd 1208.HK, Glencore's GLEN.L Antapaccay and Constancia of Canada's Hudbay Minerals HBM.TO. In Chumbivilcas Castillo won 96.5% of votes.
""The people have awakened,"" Castillo told supporters on Thursday night. He has previously criticized mining firms for ""plundering"" the country's wealth and has maintained taxation on mineral profits will have to rise sharply to raise funds.
Overall, the election data showed that Castillo received more than 65% support in at least 10 provinces where key copper, gold, silver, and zinc mines are located, giving him a strong mandate in those areas to push reforms.
The election has not yet officially been called, but Castillo is expected to hold on to his narrow 50.2%-49.8% lead after gaining strong support from poor rural areas with pledges to redraft Peru's constitution and redistribute mineral wealth.
Fujimori, a divisive but market-friendly candidate, had looked to lure support from mining regions with a pledge to give funds raised from mining directly to local communities, but the move appears to have fallen short with voters.
Castillo meanwhile promised a far larger shake-up, with plans to retain up to 70% of mining profits, which he wants to invest in healthcare and education reforms, especially in mineral-rich areas that have high poverty rates.
Mining firms have largely waited on the sidelines to see how things shake out, hopeful that a split vote and fragmented Congress, where no party will have a majority, will help temper any sharp reforms.
""We need to recognize what happened here and that what has led to the polarization is the frustration of years due to the political instability and the inefficiency of the state,"" said Roque Benavides, president of Buenaventura BVN.N mining firm.
He denied that the issue was with the mining industry, though said that firms could be compelled to make voluntary contribution payments in discussion with a new administration.
""I feel that the political circumstances could lead us to that a little. But nothing will be achieved if there is not efficient spending and investment,"" he added
The mining sector represents some 60% of Peru's total exports and will be key as the country looks to bounce back from the world's deadliest per capita COVID-19 outbreak, which has triggered an economic collapse and sharp rise in poverty.
The strong support for Castillo was not only in areas where large mines are already developed, but also where new mining sites are being built, an analysis of the data showed.
He received some 86.3% of he vote in the southern district of Torata, where Anglo American AAL.L and Japan's Mitsubishi 8058.T are developing the $5.3 billion Quellaveco copper mine, set to begin production in 2022.
In the area of Haquira, home to a $1.8 billion planned project by Canadian First Quantum FM.TO, 96% of the residents chose Castillo over Fujimori.

1192.0,2014-02-26 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa Inks Deal for Quebec Smelters - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-inks-deal-for-quebec-smelters-analyst-blog-2014-02-26,,,"Aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) and the Government of Quebec have signed an agreement to improve the competitiveness of the former's three smelters in Quebec. Per the deal, Hydro-Quebec will renew Alcoa's power supply contracts for the Becancour and Deschambault facilities till 2030 and for the Baie-Comeau plant through 2036. This will save about 3000 jobs in Quebec.
The deal will allow Alcoa to invest about $250 million at the smelters over the next five years. Alcoa will also increase their aluminum production but reduce production of commodity-grade aluminum at the Baie-Comeau casthouse in order to meet the growing demand of aluminum from automakers for more fuel-efficient vehicles.
As per the automakers, aluminum body sheet content in North American vehicles is expected to increase four-fold by 2015 and ten-fold by 2025, from 2012 levels.
These actions represent Alcoa's strategy of making capital investments, moving down the cost curve and curtailing capacities in its upstream business. The curtailments will improve the competitiveness of the company's Primary Products business.
Smelting aluminum requires large amounts of electricity, so power costs play a big role in determining where aluminum producers choose to build their smelters. Hence, Alcoa will support the government's electric transportation strategy by considering the Baie-Comeau facility as a possible source of aluminum for emerging technology applications, including aluminum-air batteries.
Alcoa also stated that it no longer plans to build a new potline to replace the two it closed at its Baie-Comeau facility last year.
Alcoa, a prominent player in the mining industry along with Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd. ( ACH ), Atlatsa Resources Corp. ( ATL ) and BHP Billiton Ltd. ( BHP ), is a world leader in production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina.
Alcoa currently retains a short-term Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

578.0,2023-01-12 00:00:00 UTC,Will Alcoa (AA) Disappoint in Q4 Earnings on Lower Shipments?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-alcoa-aa-disappoint-in-q4-earnings-on-lower-shipments,,,"Alcoa Corporation AA is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 18, after market close.

The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, while missing in one.

Let’s see how things are shaping up for Alcoa this earnings season.
Alcoa Price and EPS Surprise
Alcoa price-eps-surprise | Alcoa Quote
Factors to Note
Alcoa’s fourth-quarter performance is likely to have been hurt by lower shipments in Alumina due to reduced production rates at the San Ciprián refinery in Spain to combat high natural gas prices and lower volumes in Aluminum due to reduced trade in Europe amid ongoing geopolitical tensions among other factors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the fourth quarter indicates a 22.4% decline from the year-ago reported figure.

High energy costs, primarily in Europe due to war tensions and raw material cost inflation, are expected to have dented Alcoa’s bottom line in the fourth quarter.

The Bauxite segment’s performance is likely to have suffered due to lower shipments as a result of decreased demand in the Atlantic bauxite market and lower demand from some Alumina segment refineries, among other factors. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the unit’s fourth-quarter sales (third-party sales + intersegment sales) hints at a 4.7% decrease from the year-ago reported number.

An anticipated reduction in shipments in the Alumina segment is expected to have weighed on total sales (third-party sales + intersegment sales). The consensus estimate for total Alumina sales in the fourth quarter suggests a 27.5% plunge from the year-ago reported number.

The Aluminum segment sales are likely to reflect the impact of lower shipments due to the partial curtailment of the Warrick smelter, among other factors and reduced trading activities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales from the segment shows a 24.5% drop from the fourth quarter of 2021 reported figure.
What Does the Zacks Model Say?
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Alcoa this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates, which is not the case here, as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Earnings ESP: Alcoa has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 76 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Highlights of Q3 Earnings
In the third quarter of 2022, Alcoa incurred a loss of 33 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 9 cents. In the year-ago period, the company had reported earnings of $2.05 per share. Total revenues of $2.85 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.33%. The top line declined 8.4% year over year.
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may want to consider from the Zacks Industrial Products sector, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this season:

Caterpillar CAT has an Earnings ESP of +1.87% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings numbers on Jan 31.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Caterpillar’s fourth-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 1% in the past 60 days. CAT pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 14.7%, on average.

WASHINGTON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications In VZ.N said on Thursday that about 30,000 non-union U.S. employees must show proof of vaccination against COVID-19 by Dec. 8 under President Joe Biden's federal contractor executive order.
Verizon, a federal contractor, said itwas in discussions with its unions about vaccination requirements. Verizon said retail employees and some other employees must be vaccinated by Feb. 1. Contractors, vendors, visitors and new hires who enter Verizon U.S. facilities must be fully vaccinated by Jan. 1.
Verizon said some ""home-based"" Verizon Consumer Group are excluded. ""At the moment, this does not apply to our union-represented employees as we are in discussion with the unions,"" Verizon said.
""While we respect that within our workforce there are people with different beliefs and perspectives related to COVID-19 and the vaccine, we must comply with the government’s requirements, including those for federal contractors.""
A growing number of federal contractors are complying with the Dec. 8 deadline.
Union Pacific Corp UNP.N, the top U.S. railroad operator, said on Wednesday it will require its 31,000 U.S. employees to be vaccinated.
Last month, U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak said it will require nearly all of its 18,000 employees be fully vaccinated by Nov. 22.
Boeing Co BA.N, another federal contractor, said on Tuesday it will require its 125,000 U.S. employees to be vaccinated.
Major U.S. airlines have said they will also meet the deadline imposed on federal contractors, including American Airlines AAL.O, Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N, JetBlue Airways Corp UNP.N and Alaska Airlines, as has aircraft parts manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems SPR.N.
The White House announced the Dec. 8 deadline for employees of federal contractors last month after Reuters reported it and the requirements are expected to cover millions of employees.
International Business Machines Corp UNP.N and Raytheon Technologies Corp have also said they will require all U.S. employees to be vaccinated.

2916.0,2023-02-03 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines (AAL)'s Technical Outlook is Bright After Key Golden Cross,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-aals-technical-outlook-is-bright-after-key-golden-cross,,,"American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) is looking like an interesting pick from a technical perspective, as the company reached a key level of support. Recently, AAL's 50-day simple moving average crossed above its 200-day simple moving average, known as a ""golden cross.""
There's a reason traders love a golden cross -- it's a technical chart pattern that can indicate a bullish breakout is on the horizon. This kind of crossover is formed when a stock's short-term moving average breaks above a longer-term moving average. Typically, a golden cross involves the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages, since bigger time periods tend to form stronger breakouts.
There are three stages to a golden cross. First, there must be a downtrend in a stock's price that eventually bottoms out. Then, the stock's shorter moving average crosses over its longer moving average, triggering a positive trend reversal. The third stage is when a stock continues the upward momentum to higher prices.
This kind of chart pattern is the opposite of a death cross, which is a technical event that suggests future bearish price movement.
Shares of AAL have been moving higher over the past four weeks, up 21.9%. Plus, the company is currently a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, suggesting that AAL could be poised for a breakout.
The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account AAL's positive earnings outlook for the current quarter. There have been 5 upwards revisions compared to none lower over the past 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up as well.
Given this move in earnings estimates and the positive technical factor, investors may want to keep their eye on AAL for more gains in the near future.

1212.0,2014-01-16 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa to Shut Two Potlines at Massena East - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-to-shut-two-potlines-at-massena-east-analyst-blog-2014-01-16,,,"Aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) announced that it will permanently shut down the remaining two potlines at its Massena East smelter in New York in the first quarter of 2014. The step has been taken by Alcoa as the potlines were no longer competitive.
The move will reduce Alcoa's smelting capacity by 84,000 tons. The company's Massena West facility will not be affected and Alcoa will work with the New York Power Authority and others to ensure its continuing success at Massena West. Alcoa's strategy of curtailments is consistent with its previously announced 2016 goal of lowering its position on the world aluminum production cost curve to the 38th percentile and the alumina cost curve to the 21st percentile.
Alcoa has already closed one of the three potlines at the Massena facility in Aug 2013. Including the closure of the remaining two potlines at Massena East, the company has announced closures or curtailments representing 361,000 metric tons of the 460,000 metric tons that were placed under review in May 2013.
After the completion of the closures of the two Massena East potlines, Alcoa will have a total smelting operating capacity of 3,950,000 metric tons, with roughly 655,000 metric tons of capacity idle. The company expects to incur restructuring-related charges of between $60 and $70 million (after-tax) or 6 cents per share, of which around 40% is non cash, in the first quarter of 2014.
Recently, Alcoa released its fourth quarter 2013 results. The company posted a loss of $2.3 billion or $2.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared with a profit of $242 million or 21 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The loss was mainly due to the sizable goodwill impairment charges of $1.7 billion related to acquisitions in the Primary Metals business.
Excluding one-time special items, earnings came in at $40 million or 4 cents per share in the reported quarter, below the year-ago earnings of $64 million or 6 cents. It also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents.
Revenues dropped roughly 5.3% to $5,585 million in the fourth quarter from $5,898 million in the year-ago quarter but exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,391 million. The decline was primarily due to weak aluminum prices which declined 7% year over year.
Alcoa is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.
Other companies in the mining industry worth considering include General Moly, Inc. ( GMO ), Atlatsa Resources Corp. ( ATL ) and Tahoe Resources Inc. ( TAHO ). All of them retain a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2135.0,2023-10-26 00:00:00 UTC,7 Undervalued Stocks to Buy Before Everyone Else,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/7-undervalued-stocks-to-buy-before-everyone-else,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Despite multiple macroeconomic issues in the past year, the market looks to finally be turning back up as 2024 nears. In 2022 and 2023, unexpected downturns from the bear market, threats of an impending recession, and inflationary pressure brought down hundreds of growing companies. Like any value investor learning from Warren Buffet, one of the most critical factors when evaluating a stock comes back to its intrinsic valuation. All investors should always be continually monitoring their investments, ensuring they are purchasing a company for less than what it is worth to get a great deal. With 2024 expected to be a much more optimistic year, in this article, we’ll highlight seven undervalued stocks that all investors should consider getting in early on.
Undervalued Stocks: RTX Corporation (RTX)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is a leading aerospace and defense company. Recently in 2023, RTX has suffered a large price decline, largely attributed to a combination of quality issues in its aircraft manufacturing business. Currently, its price sits at $73.13, with 21 Yahoo Finance analysts projecting an optimistic 1-year range between an average of $81.42 to a high of $103.73.
We support this optimistic sentiment and believe this is a perfect time for investors to add RTX at an undervalued price. With its buyback program and potential for increased defense spending due to escalating tensions in the Middle East and the continual fighting in Ukraine-Russia, we believe this company will be able to recover its slightly dampened FY estimates.
Taking a look at its financials, we see that RTX is undervalued at a P/E ratio of 14.54x, compared to its sector median of 16.02x. This valuation becomes even more attractive when looking at its historic one-year P/E mean of 27.09x. RTX’s Q2 2023 results were also optimistic, stabilizing and beating both EPS and revenue estimates. With news to also confirm their share buyback of $3B, investors should no doubt consider RTX as a discounted addition to their portfolio.
American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL)
Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com
American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) is one of the major players in the airline sector. It serves consumer and commercial clients through its vast route network, providing various travel and transportation services. The company is currently trading at $11.21, with Yahoo Finance analysts projecting a one-year price range of $8.00-$23.00, with an average target price of $15.14.
Airline stocks have been challenging for the past couple of years, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent repercussions. However, many airline companies are on an excellent pace to return to normal, pre-pandemic strength levels.
American Airlines presents an appealing investment opportunity with its P/E ratio of 2.91x, being significantly less than its industry peers average of 9.28x and its five-year historical average of 5.07x. The EPS of the company could also allow the company to be more attractive to several investors. It has a current EPS of 3.88. However, analysts from Yahoo Finance project the company to grow 368% during the current fiscal year and a growth estimate of 83.42% per annum over the next five years. With that in mind, we recommend American Airlines as among the top undervalued stocks with strong long-term potential.
Deutsche Bank Ag (DB)
Source: Martynova Anna / Shutterstock.com
Deutsche Bank Ag (NYSE:DB) is an influential figure in the banking and financial services industry as the largest bank in Germany. Yahoo Finance analysts estimate it will trade at an average one-year price of around $11.69.
The company’s financials clearly show growth at an efficient and sustainable rate. In the last 12 months, Deutsche Bank reported an impressive revenue of $28.2 billion, up ~22% from its revenue of $23 billion less than four years ago! EPS has also demonstrated consistent growth, increasing from -$2.71 at the close of 2019 to $2.42 as 2023 began.
When examining Deutsche Bank’s valuation, it is clear that the company is undervalued compared to the rest of the industry. Deutsche Bank’s P/E ratio currently stands at 4.19x, which, contrasted to the financial sector median P/E ratio of 7.91x, is almost 50% less than the industry average. Also, its P/S ratio of 0.73x TTM is a little less than 70% than that of the financial sector median, which stands at 2.15x.
With these stellar valuation ratios, DB further solidifies its place as an addition to any individual’s portfolio.
Delta Air Lines (DAL)
Source: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is a major presence in the airline industry as one of the largest and most influential carriers in the U.S. Yahoo Finance analysts estimate it will trade within a one-year price range of $43 – $77, averaging at around $53.94.
With Delta’s standing and weight in the transportation market, its low P/E and P/S ratios compared to the industry medians display it as likely being undervalued. While the industrial sector has a median P/E ratio TTM of 16.02x, Delta’s is 5.00x, a -69% difference from the sector. Similarly, for the P/S ratio, Delta’s is 0.36x TTM, while the sector’s is at 1.27x, meaning Delta’s P/S ratio was at a 72% decrease from the sector average.
Looking at its financials, we see that its revenue has increased around 20% in the last four years, from $47 million in 2019 to $55.7 million TTM. While COVID-19 played a large role in the company’s drop to an EPS of -$19.49 in 2020, it is Delta’s rise back to a value of $2.07 in 2022 that shows its adaptability and growth. Overall, Delta Airlines would be a great pick for anyone looking for undervalued stocks.
Clearfield, Inc (CLFD)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
Clearfield (NASDAQ:CLFD) produces everything needed to conduct electricity efficiently, from resistors and inductors to their new fiber optics for wires. With more fiber technology being used in the future, Clearfield indeed has massive growth potential. In fact, four Yahoo Finance analysts predict the stock to trade with a range of $24 to $52 and an average of $45.
Clearfield’s newest product is the fiber optics cassette, which can single-handedly fix multiple wired connections and connect up to ten wires together, allowing for a considerable increase in productivity in the system. Integrating these innovative products into existing wired connections will increase the network speed significantly, giving them an edge over the competition.
Clearfield’s valuation is also relatively cheap, with a P/E ratio of 8.28x compared to the industry’s 14.78x and its five-year average of 19.16x. Additionally, in the past two years alone, its EPS and profits have grown significantly, as EPS grew 141% and profits grew 81%. With a historically discounted P/E ratio, steady growth, and new, innovative products coming out, this undervalued stock will surely have some explosive growth soon.
Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO)
Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com
Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) is a leading developer, marketer, and publisher in the gaming industry. Yahoo Finance analysts estimate that this stock will trade within a one-year price range of $104-$171 with an average of $156.96. Its analyst estimate is 30% below its fair value estimate. That’s why we think it is one of the best-undervalued stocks.
Take-Two Interactive is the creator of the Grand Theft Auto series, the 2k games, and Red Dead Redemption, and is one of the biggest entertainment providers for consumers. Despite TTWO’s recent costly acquisition of Zynga, I believe this partnership with a provider of free-to-play games will lead to an overall net gain in the long term.
According to a Wall Street analyst, TTWO is expected to hit a price of US$157, putting it 30% below its fair value estimate. With a historically sufficient cash runaway and likely stabilization in 2024, I highly recommend TTWO to any investor looking for a massive return on their discounted investment.
Novartis AG (NVS)
Source: Denis Linine / Shutterstock.com
Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS) is a Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer with a long history of innovative drugs. The share price is up over 28% in the last year and currently sits at $94.69. The stock has an average 1-year price target of $112.75, according to 4 Yahoo finance analysts.
Its breast cancer drug Kisqali was found to significantly cut the risk of recurrence and has been approved to treat hormone-driven breast cancer. With this new approval and success, it is likely to be a new drug, boosting its revenue in the future. In terms of valuation, its current P/E sits at 14.26x compared to the sector median of 17.16x, a staggering difference of over 16%. With EPS expected to grow at an average of just over 6% for the next few years, Novartis presents investors with a promising investment with plenty of upside. Thus, it is one of the best undervalued stocks, in our opinion.

2092.0,2023-11-22 00:00:00 UTC,Rocky Brands and Skyworks Solutions have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/rocky-brands-and-skyworks-solutions-have-been-highlighted-as-zacks-bull-and-bear-of-the,,,"For Immediate Release
Chicago, IL – November 22, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Rocky Brands RCKY as the Bull of the Day and Skyworks Solutions SWKS as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, United Airlines Holdings, Inc. UAL and Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL.
Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
Bull of the Day:
Boasting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and landing the Bull of the Day, Rocky Brands is a trending retail apparel stock to consider right now. Rocky Brands' Zacks Shoes and Retail Apparel Industry is currently in the top 16% of over 250 Zacks industries with other standouts including Adidas and Skechers.
However, after crushing third quarter top and bottom line expectations earlier in the month the strengthening outlook of Rocky Brands may be the most compelling at the moment.
Q3 Review: As a leading provider of premium quality footwear and apparel Rocky Brands Q3 earnings of $1.09 per share impressively topped the Zacks Consensus of $0.31 a share by a whopping 251%. Plus, sales of $125.61 million came in 11% better than expected.
Rocky Brands attributed the strong results to product improvement which resulted in reduced inventory levels and an acceleration in at-once orders from key wholesale partners with some of the company's brands including Rocky Outdoor Gear, Durango, and Dickies.
Year over year, Rocky Brands' Q3 earnings soared 47% from $0.74 a share in the prior year quarter despite sales falling -15%. Amid broader economic headwinds, Rocky Brands' retail segment sales did increase 4.7% YoY which is a great sign as the holiday shopping season is upon us and inventories decreased 26.5% from a year ago.
Soaring Earnings Estimates: Alluding to more upside in Rocky Brands stock is that annual earnings estimates have soared over the last 30 days. Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have skyrocketed 132% to $1.74 a share compared to estimates of $0.75 per share a month ago. Even better, FY24 EPS estimates have climbed 53% to $2.55 per share compared to estimates of $1.66 a share 30 days ago.
Attractive Valuation: Trading around $25 a share, Rocky Brands stock is up a respectable +8% this year and the company's P/E valuation also points to the plausibility of more upside. Supported by rising EPS estimates Rocky Brands stock trades at a 14.8X forward earnings multiple which is a slight discount to its industry average of 15.2X and nicely beneath the S&P 500's 21.3X.
Generous Dividend: Rocky Brands may not be as renowned as some of its well-known industry peers like Nike (NKE), Adidas, or even Skechers but the company's payout to shareholders shouldn't be overlooked.
Rocky Brands' 2.4% annual dividend yield is above the benchmark's 1.42% average and easily tops Adidas' 0.24% and Nike's 1.28% while Skechers doesn't offer a payout at the moment.
Bottom Line
With the holiday shopping season beginning, Rocky Brands stock is very attractive and now may be an ideal time to buy RCKY shares after the company's very impressive Q3 report showed increased profitability, product improvement, and reduced inventory.
Bear of the Day:
Providing a broad range of high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, the long-term outlook of Skyworks Solutions is still favorable but short-term risks lie ahead.
Specifically, Skyworks products are used in applications within the aerospace, automotive, broadband, and cellular infrastructure markets among others that relate to radio frequency.
Unfortunately, the Zacks Semiconductors-Radio Frequency Industry is currently in the bottom 14% of over 250 Zacks industries and investors may want to be cautious of Skyworks' stock at the moment which lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.
Industry Challenges & Declining Earnings Estimates
Broader economic uncertainties including higher inflation and rising interest rates have had a dismal effect on the companies within the Zacks Semiconductors-Radio Frequency Industry most notably Skyworks and Akoustis Technologies (AKTS).
Declining earnings estimates are indicative of such and suggest more short-term weakness ahead with Skyworks starting to take the brunt of its industry's weakening outlook as a leader in the space. To that point, earnings estimates for Skyworks' current fiscal 2024 have fallen -19% in the last 30 days from $8.95 per share to $7.21 a share. More concerning, FY25 EPS estimates have dropped -16% over the last month from $10.41 per share to $8.70 a share.
Stagnant Price Performance
Making the glaring drop in annual earnings estimates look even more bleak is that Skyworks' price performance and the inflationary recovery of the Semiconductor-Radio Frequency Industry have largely trailed the broader indexes.
While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have rebounded and soared +19% and +36% this year respectively Skyworks' stock is up a modest +3% with its Zacks Subindustry down -2%. Furthermore, over the last three years, Skyworks stock is still down -32% and its Zacks Subindustry has fallen -44% to largely trail the S&P 500's +27% and the Nasdaq's +19%.
Bottom Line
Given the poor price performance of Skyworks stock over the last few years the large decline in annual earnings estimates in the last month is definitely concerning. It appears that selling or avoiding Skyworks stock may be the right move at the moment as there could be much better opportunities ahead.

3 Airline Stocks in Focus Ahead of Thanksgiving
Soaring fuel and labor costs have been eating into the profits of airlines, but the holiday season is expected to turn things in favor of airline companies. The holiday season is an important window for airlines to boost revenues, and this Thanksgiving holiday period is expected to be one of the busiest ones in recent times.
Hence, investors should utilize this opportunity and invest in airline stocks like American Airlines Group Inc., United Airlines Holdings, Inc. and Delta Air Lines, Inc..
Thanksgiving Travel to Soar
Airlines took a major hit during the peak of the pandemic and the year after that as travel came to a standstill. However, the industry has since recovered from historic lows and is now gearing up for the upcoming holiday season, which is projected to see a record volume of passenger traffic.
A staggering 30 million passengers are expected to be screened between Nov 17 and Nov 28, hitting a record high, the Transportation Security Administration said.
The Sunday following Thanksgiving is projected to be the busiest day within this timeframe, with an estimated 2.9 million passengers expected to travel by air.
Weather played spoilsport last year during this time, compelling several airlines to cancel thousands of flights across the country. However, most airlines this year are ready to handle the situation more efficiently.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, Thanksgiving flights are expected to peak at 49,606 on the Wednesday preceding the holiday, surpassing last year's record of 48,192.
Expectations of record passenger traffic are high this year, particularly after airlines recorded robust traffic volumes during the Labor Day weekend.
Pent-up demand has soared since the removal of the pandemic-induced restrictions. Although higher fuel and labor costs have been posing major challenges for the airline industry, optimism is high surrounding air travel this year.
This has seen airlines gearing up to accommodate more passengers and adding 253,000 more seats per day during the period. Also, lucrative discounts are being offered to lure flyers.
According to flight-tracking site Hopper, Thanksgiving flight deals are currently averaging $248 for domestic round trips. This reflects a decrease from $271 last year and $276 in 2019, the pre-pandemic time.
According to the latest U.S. inflation report from the Department of Labor, overall airfare has declined more than 13%.

The Japanese Nikkei (INDEXNIKKEI:NI225) fell 1.4%, and the Chinese Shanghai Composite fell 2.44%. European markets began the day higher and closed near their highs of the day. After the European close, EU finance ministers were said to have approved a 3 billion euro tranche of aid to Greece to ensure that there would be no cash shortfall for the remainder of the quarter. Additionally, the finance ministers were said to move up aid payments to the third quarter due to a large number of bond redemptions in August.
US markets open higher and moved little for the rest of the day. The Nasdaq (INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC) lost 0.6% of its gains and closed around flat for the day. The leading S&P 500 (INDEXSP:.INX) sectors on the day were utilities, consumer staples, and financials with tech and telecom in the red. Lagging tech stocks were no doubt pushed down by the 1% decline in Apple ( AAPL ). The largest movement was in US Treasuries, with the 10-year yield dropping 10 basis points to 2.64%. This follows a 24-basis-point rise on Friday after the better-than-consensus payroll report.
The only economic datapoint for the day was consumer credit, which expanded by an adjusted rate of $19.05 billion in May. Consumer financed borrowing showed strong gains in non-revolving and revolving subsets, but it was little changed on an non-adjusted basis for the last year.
Dell ( DELL ) founder Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake was given the green light by corporate governance consulting firm Institutional Shareholder Services for its $24.4 billion leveraged buyout. ISS commented negatively on Carl Icahn's proposed buyout due to its leveraged nature. Dell shares closed at $13.42, up 3% for today and slightly below the $13.65 offer price. Dell shareholders will vote on the proposal July 18.
Alcoa ( AA ) kicked off earnings today with a better-than-expected report. Earnings per share rose $0.07 versus $0.06 estimates and revenues rose $5.96 billion versus $5.79 billion estimates. The company reaffirmed its global aluminum demand forecast at 7% for the year. Shares of Alcoa were up 2% from its closing price to $8.05 in after-hours trading.
Tomorrow's Financial Outlook
Tomorrow's economic data will include the small business optimism index via NFIB and same-store sales indexes from ICSC/Goldman and Redbook. The small business optimism indexes should rise given the higher wages found in last Friday's employment report. Same-store sales have trended down of late, coincident with falling consumption. Lastly, tomorrow will be the first Treasury auction of three this week.
It will be a busy day across the globe for economic data releases. The UK will release manufacturing and industrial production from May and it will also release its trade balance from May. On a month-to-month basis, the production figures are expected to gain slightly. Lastly, the NIESR institute will release its estimate of England's GDP for June. Other economic data includes the consumer inflation index from China and Japanese production orders.
Wolverine World Wide ( WWW ) will be the only notable earnings report tomorrow.

605.0,2022-12-09 00:00:00 UTC,"EPS: Winners, Losers, & Industry Themes",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/eps%3A-winners-losers-industry-themes,,,"Earnings are essential for public companies because they provide investors with a roadmap of the company’s financial performance and profitability. “Earning’s season” typically falls in January, April, July, and October after companies have had time to construct their quarterly reports. Because Alcoa AA is usually the first sizable company to report earnings each quarter, earnings season informally starts when Alcoa reports.
Whether it is earnings season or not, savvy investors understand that it is worthwhile to follow earnings reports at any time of the year. Not only do earnings and the stock’s subsequent reactions provide clues into the company itself, but the report can also give investors an early view into essential industry trends and how the general market is absorbing earnings. Despite the dismal performance in the market this week, several companies reported stellar earnings reports and reacted accordingly. Below are some recent EPS winners and losers:
 Winners: Software
MongoDB Inc MDB provides a general-purpose database platform. The company serves financial services, government, healthcare, media and entertainment, retail, technology, and telecommunications industries. Tuesday, MongoDB reported total revenue of $333.6 million, up 47% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $18.7 million or $0.23 per share versus $.03 per share last year.

Pictured: MDB revenue estimates look favorable moving foward.
While MongoDB’s fell in recent months with other tech stocks, the quarter was a potential turning point. According to Zacks Consensus Revenue Estimates for next year, the company’s growth will continue next year. One possible driver for the software firm is its burgeoning partnership with the undisputed king of software, Microsoft MSFT. The two software leaders have partnered to integrate MongoDB’s Atlas software into the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Azure has the scale to provide MDB with a growth runway for years.
Industry View: After a nasty correction in the software space, leading software stocks are showing that the poor macroeconomic backdrop of the past year was merely a bump in the road rather than a destination. Last week, Splunk (SPLK). Splunk develops software that enables organizations to gain insights into their business by accessing, managing, and analyzing data in real time. The software firm smashed Zacks Consensus Estimates by 97% and raised revenue and margin guidance. Box Inc BOX, a software platform that allows companies to manage internal and external data, content, and store files in the cloud, swung to a profit. Unlike most of its peers, Box is above its 200-day moving average, indicating strong relative strength. The Internet-Software Group is a top-tier group, ranking 60 out of the 251 groups tracked by Zacks.
Is the post-EPS drop in Salesforce a gift for investors?
Salesforce Inc CRM, the leading customer relationship platform in the world, is one of the few software stocks to fall after reporting earnings this quarter. Several high-level executives have left the company including the President and the Co-CEO in recent weeks. The founder and CEO of Slack, a key acquisition of Salesforce, also parted ways with the cloud giant. Though the recent departures are disheartening for CRM investors, the short-term weakness in the stock may spell an opportunity for longer-term value investors.

Pictured: CRM's valuation is slated to shrink over the next 12 months.
Despite the drama, Salesforce remains a juggernaut in the software space and is highly profitable. Revenue, which equates to approximately $26.5 billion in FY22, grew 25% year-over-year. Both EPS and revenue grew at a double-digit pace in Q3. Moving forward, the company anticipates revenue to continue to grow at a healthy clip of 17% for 2023. The most attractive part about CRM’s stock is the shrinking valuation (pictured above). As the stock approaches levels not seen since the heat of the Covid crash, value investors may be looking to CRM stock as a late black Friday sale.

Losers: Select Retail
This week,Lululemon Athletica LULU, the company behind a wildly popular yoga and athletic brand, was a rare post-EPS underperformer. The stock dropped by more than 10% Friday after announcing its third-quarter results. The results were strong. The company saw revenue increase 28% while EPS grew 23%. While the current results were solid, the stocks’ reaction underscores the importance of paying attention to what’s going on “under the hood” in an earnings report. According to the quarterly report, LULU’s inventory levels show $1.7 billion worth of unsold apparel, a whopping 85% increase versus last year. The Textile-Apparel Group, which LULU belongs to, ranks in the bottom 28% of all industry groups tracked by Zacks. Outside of a bounce play, LULU’s stock is an avoid at this juncture.
Discount Retail
Discount retail-giant Target TGT was among the more disappointing earnings reports recently. On December 16th, the stock sliced lower by 13% after Target reported that Q3 EPS growth dropped by 49%. The disappointing news is the third straight quarter of double-digit negative EPS growth. Even though Target is a discount retailer, the company blamed weakening profit trends on inflation rates, rising interest rates, and economic uncertainty. To make matters worse, management lowered topline and bottom-line expectations for the fourth quarter.
Costco Wholesale Corp COST, a company famous for providing its members discounted prices on goods when purchased in bulk, announced lackluster earnings. The company’s sales grew by 8% while EPS grew by a dull 4%. Friday, the COST reversed early losses to finish slightly higher. Though COST’s earnings were not devasting, they did not generate excitement like those in the software space. COST has been stuck in a choppy, frustrating range for the better part of a year:

Industry Overview:
The recent earnings trends in many retail stocks have been concerning. Specifically, in the past few weeks, companies like the ones mentioned above have delivered forward-looking statements filled with uncertainty about the economic climate and the underlying businesses. For now, from an opportunity cost perspective, there are better industries to be invested.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

1907.0,2023-10-06 00:00:00 UTC,VettaFi Voices On: Considering Commodities,AAAU,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/vettafi-voices-on%3A-considering-commodities,,,"Hi VettaFi Voices! Commodities have seen outflows year to date overall, and some of the best performers have seen outflows. We discussed the ""uncertain"" economic environment last week, but what does that mean for how investors view commodities? Are investors scared of commodities right now? Can they be a good way to diversify a portfolio or hedge inflation? Are there better ways to get exposure than an ETF wrapper?
Todd Rosenbluth, VettaFi director of research: When I think of commodity ETFs, gold is what first comes to mind. Unfortunately, it has not been working for investors. Gold ETFs are all down fractionally for the year and down 6% in the past month, when the uncertain economic concerns became more top of mind.
The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (IAU) are the two largest ETFs, and they each have $2.2 billion of net outflows year to date, with money rushing out in the past month. While the lower-cost SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (GLDM) has $450 million of net inflows this year, it had slight outflows in the past month. Others like the abrdn Physical Gold Shares ETF (SGOL) and the Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF (AAAU) have seen slight inflows this year. But this has not been a good year for the gold ETF industry.
Meanwhile, diversified commodity ETFs like the Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (PDBC), the Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC), and the First Trust Global Tactical Commodity Strategy Fund (FTGC) are down close to 3% for the year. And they too have experienced net outflows of between $400 million $600 million each.
Energy Commodities
While this ETF owns stocks and is not a commodity ETF, the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM) is notable. The miners ETF is up 37% this year. Nuclear energy is top of mind for many investors, with lots of new reactors under construction, particularly in Asia. Demand outstrips supply, and this Sprott ETF is a great way to tap into that.
Oil ETFs like the United States Oil Fund LP (USO) and the Invesco DB Oil Fund (DBO) are up around 8% in value as prices have spiked higher. I need Stacey Morris to help talk about the fundamentals here.
But USO has $750 million of net ouflows this year. Investors are not turning to commodities this year as an alternative to equity and fixed income allocations.
Stacey Morris, VettaFi head of energy research: There’s definitely a lot going on in oil markets at the moment. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) closed at a relative high of $93.68 per barrel (bbl) on September 27, and as of this writing, it’s around $83/bbl. The weakness has largely been driven by demand concerns tied to a worsening economic outlook. Wednesday’s weekly inventory report from the U.S. Department of Energy showed a big jump in gasoline inventories (up 6.5 million barrels), adding to concerns and triggering headlines on demand destruction.
Questions About Demand
Meanwhile, inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the pricing point for WTI, are at extremely low levels, which has led to more backwardation at the front of the curve. There’s been a lot of positioning and financial trading around what’s happening at Cushing. Arguably, some of the strength in oil in September likely came from short covering for WTI contracts. With demand concerns back at the forefront, oil has taken a big hit in a week, even though Saudi Arabia and Russia remain committed to their incremental cuts through the end of this year.
For more defensive energy exposure, investors may consider midstream/MLPs. The Energy Select Sector Index (IXE), which underlies the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), fell 7.1% for the week ended October 4 as oil tumbled, while the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index (AMZI), which underlies the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), was down 4.0%.
Rosenbluth: Stacey, I’m not asking forinvestment advice but what is the reward versus risk of getting energy exposure via an oil ETF like USO versus owning energy-stock-based ETFs. USO has outperformed XLE in 2023 but has lagged behind over the three-year period.
Morris: In short, USO can be more complex. It issues a K-1. Performance for USO can be impacted by the structure of the curve (contango versus backwardation), with backwardation typically more favorable. The relationship between oil and energy stocks isn't always perfect, but I think focusing on ETFs of energy companies can be a good way to get exposure to the commodity. The nice thing about energy companies is that they are largely focused on free cash flow and returning cash to investors through dividends and buybacks. You don't get those benefits from playing the commodity directly.
Don’t Dismiss Dividends
Rosenbluth: Good point. The barrel of oil is not paying a dividend ,let alone raising it like stocks inside AMLP are.
I'm looking through our database of commodities ETFs, and the KraneShares Global Carbon Strategy ETF (KRBN) jumps out as a positive performer. The fund owns carbon credit futures. It covers the major North American and European cap and trade programs.
Heather Bell, VettaFi managing editor: I feel like we’re overlooking agricultural commodities, though admittedly as a whole, they haven’t done much this year. Despite Ukraine’s role as a major grain producer, wheat prices are down. Based on this article from CNBC, it’s because Ukraine is finding ways to export despite the collapse of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, and production is better than expected.
But agricultural commodities are pretty important to human survival. And with all the unexpected weather events we’re having, that raises uncertainty around agriculture. That said, a lot of agricultural commodities are down year to date. The Invesco DB Agriculture Fund (DBA) is only up 6.4%, with a lot of the upside likely due to sugar -- which is on a tear -- and also the fund’s largest holding. The Teucrium Sugar Fund (CANE) is up roughly 53% during the same time period. I’m a sugar addict, so that increase makes sense to me!
The Crypto Angle
Roxanna Islam Swan, VettaFi asociate director of research: I think regardless of the current outlook, if you want exposure to commodities at any point, you'll likely want an ETF. Buying physical commodities like metals is possible, but then you have to think about storing it. Other commodities are basically impossible to buy and store (like agricultural commodities). Futures can be complex. And while commodity producer stocks can be a good choice, it opens up exposure to a lot of idiosyncrasies that you may not want. Energy stocks might have some widespread popularity, but other commodity stocks are more difficult for the average investor to get into. I'm thinking of areas like gold mining stocks and crypto miners.
Rosenbluth: I knew crypto would find its way in here. I mean, we had the first ether futures ETFs launch this week.
Islam: And I think the bitcoin example is a good way to describe how people feel about commodities, because it's in the news every day (and yes, most people consider bitcoin to be a commodity). You can buy physical bitcoin and store it in a private wallet, or you can buy it in your brokerage account as an ETF. Many investors would prefer the convenience of an ETF.
Commodities in Perspective
Rosenbluth: And you make a good point of the ease of use with a spot commodity ETF. Owning GLDM or AAAU is much easier than buying and hoping to sell gold bars at some point.
Islam: With the cost of housing lately, most people probably don't have the square footage to have their own gold vault!
Also, commodities aren't built equally. There's actually pretty low correlation between different commodities and different supply/demand dynamics. It seems like more long-term investors lean toward more ""mainstream"" areas like gold and bitcoin, for example. Otherwise, many of the others are used as tactical tilts. Still, there's an overall low correlation of commodities with stocks and bonds, so a main benefit is diversification. Remember that commodity allocations are usually small, like 5% of a portfolio, so they shouldn't be as scary as they seem.
Rosenbluth: Yes, commodities can play a role in a portfolio, especially if the ETF is diversified. The Harbor Commodity All-Weather Strategy ETF (HGER) is a good example that has precious metals, grains, industrials, and energy exposure.

These were some of the darkest days of the COVID-19 market crash in the spring. All of these stocks had fallen much further than the market as a whole and many Robinhood investors were eager to cash in on a quick turnaround. Sales of airline seats and theme park tickets would surely surge over the summer, alongside renewed interest in Ford trucks. GE had just found a buyer of its struggling consumer lighting business and the company's aviation segment would benefit from a refreshed airline sector.
All of these investment theses assumed a quick recovery from the spring's coronavirus lockdowns.

How are these ideas working out in reality?
The summer came and went. The pandemic didn't go away. There is light at the end of the tunnel thanks to several successful coronavirus vaccine programs, but the health crisis itself and the mitigation efforts designed to fight it cut some deep scars in established business ideas. The effects on this short list of popular Robinhood investments were mixed.
Ford reopened its shuttered factories over the summer and launched several promising models that should sell nicely in 2021. The company's strategy for electric vehicles remains unclear but the idea of running its own used-car website could be a winner.
GE's multiyear turnaround story continued with an increased focus on healthcare and renewable energy operations. The lack of a sharp rebound in airline travel led to pressure on General Electrics' aviation business, resulting in another round of job cuts in the jet engine sector.
Disney reopened its theme parks but drew small crowds amid strict social distancing rules. The movie industry is still effectively closed down, forcing the House of Mouse to rethink its entire film business and move many premieres from the silver screen to streaming services.
Delta and American Airlines continue to face dramatic declines in ticket sales and travel plans. Delta's third-quarter sales plunged 79% year over year and American's revenue dropped 73% for the same period. The Center for Disease Control recommended that Americans cancel their travel plans for Thanksgiving due to skyrocketing coronavirus infections. These negative trends didn't stop airline stocks from a dramatic takeoff in November as three separate vaccine trials reported promising results.
Real-world market results
Let's imagine that you invested $10,000 in each of these popular Robinhood stocks six months ago. Here's how those positions would have developed until now:
F data by YCharts.
All of these stocks are beating the broader market. The S&P 500 index rose 19.9% over the same period, just below Walt Disney's 21.5% gain at the bottom of this list. The original $50,000 investment has grown to $69,900 today, which works out to an average gain of 40%.
Time will tell how these investments may perform in the long run, but Robinhood's most popular turnaround ideas of the late spring have delivered solid results in the first six months.
I would hesitate to buy most of these stocks today, given that the recent surge in COVID-19 cases may lead to a second round of widespread lockdowns around the country and the world. At the same time, I'm keeping a close eye on high-quality companies like Walt Disney and Ford, ready to pounce if the lockdowns arrive and drive their share prices lower again. In particular, I see Disney repositioning itself as a budding leader in streaming video platforms. I would love to pick up more Disney shares on the cheap, even at the cost of long-term trouble in the company's theme parks and resorts division.

907.0,2022-01-19 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa (AA) Q4 Earnings: What to Expect,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-aa-q4-earnings%3A-what-to-expect,,,"S
hares of the aluminum giant Alcoa (AA) have been one of the bright spots in the materials sector, rising more than 60% over the past six months, including 24% over the past thirty days. Already up 4% year to date, besting the 2% decline in the S&P 500 index, Alcoa has a lot to prove in 2022.
The company is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. The rise in metal stocks have been driven by optimism surrounding infrastructure spending aimed at repairing the country’s airports, roads and bridges, among other projects. How much of that money will come to Alcoa? Aluminum is used in a broad range of industrial and consumer end markets. And the commodity is enjoying a strong run as the global economy swings back into motion.
As a result, Alcoa last quarter posted its tenth consecutive quarterly profit beat, thanks to improving aluminum business. Q3 revenue rose 31% year over year to $3.11 billion, beating expectations by almost $200 million. Aside from Alcoa’s own strong operational performance, the company is being rewarded for an improved balance sheet and its overall financial position which included a focus on scaling the alumina and aluminum production segment. Analysts at Jefferies recently reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raise their price target to $75, reflecting 22% premium from current levels.
Citing, among other things, high aluminum prices and better than expected free cash flow and capital returns, Jefferies urged investors to ""stay long and buy more on a dip."" Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank cited what it believes to be a high valuation and downgraded the shares to Hold from Buy. While there appears to be support for higher aluminum prices, the company on Wednesday must speak positively about the demand/supply outlook for the next several quarters to keep Alcoa stock in high demand as it has been.
For the quarter that ended December, Wall Street expects the New York-based company to earn $1.89 per share on revenue of $3.33 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 26 cents per share on revenue of $2.39 billion. For the full year, earnings are projected to be $6.28 per share, up from a loss of $1.16 a year ago, while full-year revenue of $12.24 billion would rise 32% year over year.
For Alcoa, the quarterly and yearly upbeat revenue and profit forecasts are impressive when considering where these estimates were at the height of the pandemic as the company dealt with oversupply conditions which has been the result of lowered demand and suspending operations. Analyst at Morgan Stanley believes that mining stocks are cheap despite their strong two-year performance. Morgan Stanley expects year-end 2022 for global investment to reach 121% of pre-recession levels, topping its decade average.
These estimates have begun to bear fruit for Alcoa which in the third quarter, beat on both the top and bottom lines. Q3 revenue rose 31.5% year over year to $3.11 billion, beating expectations by almost $200 million, while Q3 adjusted EPS of $2.05 beat by 25 cents. Just as impressive, Q3 adjusted EBITDA totaled $728 million, topping the year-ago total of $284 million and above analysts estimates of $697 million.
With a cash balance of $1.45 billion with no substantial debt maturities for five years, Alcoa has tons of firepower with which to maneuver from a capital return perspective. Until there is clear signs of business deterioration Alcoa stock will continue to shine.

1871.0,2010-07-09 00:00:00 UTC,The Best Ideas of the Week,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-ideas-week-2010-07-09,,,"Get ready for earnings season . Alcoa (NYSE: AA ) kicks off the fun on Monday, followed by a big slate of blue chips. By the end of next week, we'll have a clear tone in place for the remainder of earnings season.
Before then, let's look back at companies in the news from this past week. Here are some of the most compelling stocks from this week's Street Authority Winners and Losers.
Taseko Mines (AMEX: TGB )
Shares of Taseko Mines have rebounded a bit from Tuesday's sell-off, but as we noted then . Investors may have gone too far in their zeal to unload shares. As we noted, the company's primary active mining site, known as Gibraltar, is probably worth around $4 a share based on projected cash flows -- right around the current share price. So even as the company's promising-yet-troubled second mine, Prosperity, is beset by a daunting local ecological assessment, investors are assigning zero value to it.
That looks to be short-sighted. There's a decent chance the mining venture will get the green light from federal regulators in Ottawa at the end of the summer. If that happens, investors will quickly push shares up, perhaps past the 52-week high of $6.21 as the new mine has even greater potential than the existing mine.
Action to Take --> In a best case scenario, shares could rise +150% to the $10 mark if both mines produce vigorous amounts of copper and lead. Full production wouldn't come until around 2013, so it would take time to hit that target.
Kohl's (NYSE: KSS )
Investors should always maintain a wish list containing great companies that currently appear to be fully-valued. Any time one of these companies gets pulled down on near-term worries, long-term investors should take advantage of that myopia. In recent weeks, we highlightedBest Buy (NYSE: BBY ) and Bed, Bath & Beyond (Nasdaq: BBBY ) as clear examples. This week, we have another example -- Kohl's. The retailer posted monthly sales that were good -- not great -- and shares took a hit . They're now off roughly -20% in the past few months, which spells B-A-R-G-A-I-N.
Citigroup's Deborah Weinswig sees shares rising from a recent $47 to $68, noting that Kohl's ""has a significant opportunity to emerge as a major player in the moderate retail space,"" adding that ""a combination of industry consolidation and company-specific initiatives should enhance both top-line and margin performance at Kohl's."" The retailer's annual per share profits have been stuck on the $3 to $4 range during the past four years, but should move past the $4 mark in fiscal (January) 2012 and closer to $5 in the subsequent year if the economy hangs in there and starts to modestly rebound.
Big Five Sporting Goods (Nasdaq: BGFV )
It's tough to buy stocks when the news is bad. But often times, that's the only way to make money. Big Five Sporting Goods, which operates a chain of retail stores primarily in the Western United States, noted that unfavorable weather in May has led to a quarterly shortfall . That bad news is good news for investors not yet in this stock, as it's a rare misstep that has temporarily weakened shares. Yet in the long-term, there is much to like about this retailer's slow-and-steady growth trajectory.
Action to Take --> We recently took a fairly deep look at the company's operations, and found a winning retail formula . Shares traded for $30 back in 2005, but can now be had for around $10. As consumer spending starts to rebound -- which probably won't happen before 2011 -- this could start to be a solid growth story one again. Long-term investors will likely bid shares back up before such an upturn is fully in evidence.

3860.0,2022-01-18 00:00:00 UTC,U.S. FAA halts review of FedEx proposal to install A321 laser-based missile-defense system,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-faa-halts-review-of-fedex-proposal-to-install-a321-laser-based-missile-defense-0,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was withdrawing proposed conditions that could have allowed delivery company FedEx Corp FDX.Nto install a laser-based missile-defense on Airbus A321-200 airplanes.
The FAA said Tuesday it ""has determined that further internal study is necessary."" The FAA said to avoid confusion ""a comment period on a proposal that the agency is not moving forward at this time, the FAA is withdrawing the notice."" FedEx did not comment Tuesday and the FAA declined comment beyond the withdrawal.
The FAA had said on Friday it was proposing conditions and opening the proposal for public comment.
In October, 2019, FedEx applied for approval to use a feature that emits infrared laser energy outside the aircraft as a countermeasure against heat-seeking missiles, the FAA disclosed Friday.
For decades, the airline industry and several governments have been grappling with the threat to airliners from shoulder-fired missiles known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, or MANPADs. Some use infrared systems to target an aircraft's engines.
""The FedEx missile-defense system directs infrared laser energy toward an incoming missile, in an effort to interrupt
the missile’s tracking of the aircraft’s heat,"" the FAA document said.
According to the U.S. State Department, more than 40 civil airplanes have been hit by MANPADs since the 1970s.
In November 2002, two missiles narrowly missed an Arkia Israeli Airlines Boeing 757 passenger jet on take-off from Mombasa airport, and efforts to combat the threat accelerated.
In 2003, an Airbus A300 freighter flown by DHL was damaged by MANPADs and forced to make an emergency landing in Baghdad.
In 2007 and 2008, FedEx took part in a U.S. government trial of anti-missile technology for civil planes by installing Northrop Grumman's NOC.N Guardian countermeasures system on some commercial cargo flights while BAE Systems BAES.L said it had installed its JetEye system on an American Airlines airplane.

3259.0,2022-09-15 00:00:00 UTC,5 Broker-Friendly Stocks to Watch as Inflation Stays Red Hot,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-broker-friendly-stocks-to-watch-as-inflation-stays-red-hot,,,"Inflation in the United States remains sky-high, implying that market volatility is still rampant. Data released on Sep 13 showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for August 2022 was up 8.3% year over year. The reading was above analysts’ expectations of an 8.1% rise. The greater-than-expected increase came despite a 10.6% decline in gasoline prices. Higher shelter, food and medical care prices caused the high inflation reading. The red-hot inflation data induced fears that consumer spending will decline sharply in the days ahead. 
The Fed already hiked interest rates 225 basis points so far this year. The August reading more or less confirms that the Fed will opt for a sharp rate hike (probably another 75-basis-point increase) later this month. Higher interest rates result in the cost of borrowing moving north. This escalates the chances of an economic slowdown.
Despite the current turmoil, shunning equities is never advisable for investors. So what’s the way forward? One ideal solution is to pay heed to broker advice while designing one’s portfolio in the current scenario of high-interest rates. Broker-friendly stocks like American Airlines AAL, CVR Energy CVI, Builders FirstSource BLDR, McKesson MCK and Beacon Roofing Supply BECN are worth keeping on one’s radar for healthy returns amid this market bloodbath.
Why Broker Advice is the Way Forward
Brokers have an in-depth understanding of stocks, great knowledge of the industry and a firm grasp over the broader economy. They scrutinize a company’s fundamentals and weigh the same against the prevalent economic scenario to find out how attractive or creditworthy a stock is as an investment bet.
After thorough research work, brokers recommend (buy, sell or hold) a stock. Such well-researched information is not available to individual investors. So, in the absence of proper guidance, they may end up selecting the wrong stocks for their portfolio. This might waste their hard-earned money, which they invested in the stock markets. To avoid such an unfortunate scenario, it is ideal for investors to be guided by an expert’s know-how while picking a basket of lucrative stocks.
Winning Strategy
The above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a winning portfolio of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward revisions of earnings estimates over the last four weeks.
Also, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is included. The price/sales ratio takes care of a company’s top line, making the strategy foolproof.
Screening Criteria
# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.
% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.
To ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we added the following screening parameters:
Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.
Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.
Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.
Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.
Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks.
Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:
American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.

3750.0,2022-03-07 00:00:00 UTC,Why Southwest Airlines Stock Remains A Favorable Bet,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-southwest-airlines-stock-remains-a-favorable-bet,,,"The shares of Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) are again observing a downtrend due to rising benchmark prices and macroeconomic uncertainty triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war. The stock has lost $7.5 billion in market capitalization since February 2020 despite multiple rounds of payroll support assistance provided by the U.S. government. Amid growing fears of slow economic growth due to rising commodity prices, Southwest Airlines is expected to benefit from fuel hedges in the near-term. Notably, the company has a hedge position on almost 60% of the targeted fuel consumption for 2022. Per analyst presentation, Southwest is slated to observe $0.78 of hedging gain per gallon at Brent price of $120. Our interactive dashboard on Southwest’s valuation highlights the historical trends in revenues, earnings, valuation multiple, and forecast for FY2022.
Before the pandemic, Southwest’s revenues observed an average growth rate of 3.4% p.a. from $20 billion in 2016 to $22 billion in 2019. The company primarily earns its revenues from the sale of air tickets and other ancillary services such as freight & mail. Top line expansion has been assisted by continued capacity growth and rising ticket prices. Historically, the company’s net margins have remained relatively flat within the 10-12% range, but EPS increased by 23% from $3.48 in 2016 to $4.28 in 2019 due to regular share buybacks.
Passenger and Air Cargo Demand Remains Strong
In recent months, investors have been optimistic on Atlas Air stock (NASDAQ: AAWW), a global provider of leased aircraft and aviation operating services. Atlas Air stock has more than doubled from pre-pandemic levels as the air freight market observed a surge in demand. Atlas Air provides air cargo services whereas Southwest caters to domestic passenger demand. Moreover, Southwest’s domestic business contributes around 95% of total revenues. Passenger numbers at TSA checkpoints breached the 2 million mark in mid-February despite the broader concerns of rising inflation and supply chain disruptions.

Across the markets…
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU23) today are down -25 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is up +8.4 bp to 3.950%.  Sep T-notes today fell to a 2-week low, and the 10-year T-note yield climbed to a 2-week high of 3.956%.  T-notes are selling off today from stronger-than-expected U.S. economic reports on Q2 GDP, weekly jobless claims, Jun pending home sales, and Jun capital goods new orders, which are hawkish for Fed policy.  Also, supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $35 billion of 7-year T-notes later today. 
The dollar index (DXY00) today recovered from early losses and is up by +0.76% at a 2-week high.  Stronger-than-expected U.S. economic news today on Q2 GDP and weekly jobless claims boosted T-note yields and supported the dollar.  Also, weakness in the euro supports the dollar as EUR/USD fell to a 2-week low on dovish comments from ECB President Lagarde.
EUR/USD (^EURUSD) today is down by -0.69%.  The euro relinquished early gains today and tumbled to a 2-week low, even after the ECB raised its main refinancing rate by 25 bp as expected. EUR/USD retreated after ECB President Lagarde said, ""The near-term economic outlook for the Eurozone has deteriorated,” and ECB officials ""have an open mind as to what decisions will be in September,” signaling the ECB may pause its rate hike cycle.
ECB President Lagarde said, ""The near-term economic outlook for the Eurozone has deteriorated owing largely to weaker domestic demand.""

USD/JPY (^USDJPY) is up by +0.37%.  The yen today gave up overnight gains and turned lower after stronger-than-expected U.S. economic reports pushed T-note yields higher.

August gold (GCQ3) today is down -26.7 (-1.36%), and Sep silver (SIU23) is down -0.705 (-2.82%).  Precious metals prices this morning are sharply lower, with gold and silver falling to 2-week lows.  A rally in the dollar index today to a 2-week high is bearish for metals.  Precious metals are also under pressure from today’s stronger-than-expected U.S. economic news on Q2 GDP, weekly initial unemployment claims, and Jun pending home sales that signal strength in the economy, which may prompt the Fed to keep raising interest rates.  In addition, fund liquidation of long gold holdings is weighing on gold prices after long gold holdings in ETFs fell to a new 3-year low Wednesday.

A wide range of travel and entertainment stocks traded up on encouraging news concerning the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine and growing hope things will be returning to normal soon.
Airline stocks joined the rally, bolstered by a sectorwide upgrade by one Wall Street bank. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL) led the way higher, up 10% in late-morning trading, while shares of JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ: JBLU), Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: UAL), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) all traded up more than 5% apiece.
So what
Airline stocks were hit hard in 2020 as the pandemic swept across the globe and wiped out demand for travel. The only way to make a bull case for the industry is a vaccine, and a steady flow of good news concerning the effectiveness of the vaccines and the progress being made distributing the shots has shares of airlines, as well as other recovery trade stocks, on the upswing.

Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Linenberg is a believer. The analyst on Monday upgraded eight airline stocks, including American, Delta, JetBlue, and Spirit, from hold to buy, saying that the sector is ""back on track."" The number of new COVID-19 cases, the number of hospitalizations, and the vaccination rates are all ""trending in the right direction,"" he writes, which means it is time for investors to warm to the airlines.
American and United were seen as among the most vulnerable major carriers heading into the crisis, and those stocks have been among the most beaten down. Delta and Spirit, meanwhile, are well positioned to take advantage of the early days of a recovery. JetBlue is a partner of American and could benefit if American leans on the new codeshare agreement while it attempts to get its balance sheet in order post-pandemic.
Now what
The worst is over, but the recovery will take time. The airlines added billions in additional debt during the crisis that will take time to work down. And some of the more lucrative parts of the business, international and business travel, will likely to take longer than leisure traffic to recover.
It's interesting to note that while many of the stocks still trade below where they were prior to the pandemic, airline enterprise values -- a measure of a company's market capitalization plus its total debt -- are near where they were before the crisis. That implies the next leg up in an airline rally might not come until the companies are healthy enough to pay down that debt.
For now, investors should continue to assume there will be a slow, steady recovery and should focus on best-of-breed airlines including Delta and Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) as the best long-term investments. Spirit, with its industry-low cost structure and focus on leisure traffic, still looks like a good bet to be among the first to fully recover for those looking at a stock for the coming months.
The fear and uncertainty that weighed on airline stocks in 2020 is starting to recede, but there is still potential for turbulence ahead. It's safe to board these stocks, but keep your seat belts fastened.

809.0,2022-04-17 00:00:00 UTC,"Weekly Preview: Earnings To Watch This Week (AA, IBM, NFLX, TSLA)",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/weekly-preview%3A-earnings-to-watch-this-week-aa-ibm-nflx-tsla,,,"T
he stock market took a much-needed break on Friday in observance of Good Friday. But it wasn’t before equities finished lower Thursday, logging sharp declines for the second consecutive week. However, investors received confirmation on what they've known for several weeks each time they've pulled out their wallet -- inflation picked up again in March.
Earlier in the week, the U.S. Department of Labor reported the consumer price index (CPI) surged 8.5% on the year in March — the hottest inflation reading since December 1981. The CPI measures the cost of a group of everyday items such as food and gas. It’s true that wages for many Americans have also risen over the past year. But for many workers, it hasn't risen enough to keep up pace with inflation. And this will force households to make tough decisions on what they are willing to cut back on.
Evidenced by the market’s reaction during the abbreviated trading week, with all three major averages booking weekly declines, investors aren’t taking chances that things will immediately improve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 113.36 points, or 0.3%, to end Thursday’s session at 34,451.23. Among the Dow’s notable decliners were Apple (AAPL), Salesforce (CRM) and Walt Disney (DIS). The S&P 500 lost 54 points, or 1.2%, finishing at 4,392.59, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 292.51 points, or 2.1%, to close at 13,351.08.
The Nasdaq was pressured by 3.66% decline in shares of Tesla (TSLA) which has been in the news lately, particularly because of CEO Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover bid for social media giant Twitter (TWTR). Reports of supply chain disruptions was also a headwind for many technology companies, notably Apple which declined 3%. For the week, the Nasdaq Composite was the biggest decliner, falling 2.6%, while the S&P 500 gave up 2.1%. Recording a third straight week of losses, the Dow lost 0.8%.
These declines come despite what has been somewhat encouraging quarterly earnings results from banking heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC). While the results from the banks weren’t stellar in the broad sense, the group was facing tough year-over-year comparisons. Plus, estimates had called for year-over-year declines for the sector. Nevertheless, first quarter earnings season kicks into high gear with results expected from technology heavyweight Netflix.
Can earnings pull tech stocks out of the doldrums? Netflix is one of several names worth watching this week:
IBM (IBM) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Apr. 19
Wall Street expects IBM to earn $1.39 per share on revenue of $13.87 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earning were $1.77 per share on $17.34 billion in revenue.
What to watch: IBM has always been a great stock to buy for dividend investors, but has the company become more appealing to growth investors as well? The tech giant has struggled to grow revenues over the past decade and has not benefited in the massive economic expansion that saw cloud leaders such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) produce double-digit revenue gains. But as it transitions away from its legacy businesses, IBM’s turnaround has seemingly begun. The company’s cloud ambitions have shown some promise in recent quarters and has provided ample revenue strength to support a higher multiple, thanks to its Red Hat acquisition, which modernized its cloud business. Citing the quality of IBM’s new leadership, namely CEO Arvind Krishna, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring recently raised his rating on the stock to Overweight from equal-weight, and inched the price target to $150 per share from $147. It appears the market is giving IBM more credit for the recent traction the company has made towards the cloud. But for the the shares to maintain their uptrend, the company on Tuesday will need to demonstrate continued operating leverage and revenue growth acceleration.
Netflix (NFLX) - Reports after the close, Tuesday, Apr. 19
Wall Street expects Netflix to earn $2.90 per share on revenue of $7.93 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $3.75 per share on $7.16 billion in revenue.
What to watch: Netflix stock has underperformed the market significantly in 2022, falling 35% and 46% in the respective three and six months. The stock has also plunged 38% and 37% over the past nine months and 12 months, respectively. Is now a buying opportunity? Not according to Benjamin Swinburne, analyst at Morgan Stanley. Citing declining estimates for net subscriber additions, Swinburne recently trimmed estimates and his price target on Netflix to $425 per share, down from $450. Although he kept his Equal Weight rating intact, the analyst cut his Q1 estimate for global paid net new subscribers down from 2.5 million to 2 million. While the market broadly expects Netflix to remain a successful streamer in 2022, Swinburne said he doesn’t expect Netflix to grow new subscribers its pre-pandemic rate of about at the 25 million per year. This has prompted some investors to wonder whether the company can maintain its status as the king of streaming. That question will be answered when Netflix issues its guidance forecast for the next quarter and full year.
Alcoa (AA) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Apr. 20
Wall Street expects Alcoa to earn $2.90 per share on revenue of $3.44 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 79 cents per share on revenue of $2.65 billion.
What to watch: Shares of the aluminum giant continues to shine, rising some 20% over the past month and more than 80% over the past six months. Not only is the stock up almost 50% year over date, compared with the 8% drop in the S&P 500 index, if you’ve bought and held Alcoa stock in the previous 52 weeks, you’re sitting pretty with a gain of 163%. During that span the S&P 500 is up just 6.5%. The rise in metal stocks have been driven by optimism surrounding infrastructure spending aimed at repairing the country’s airports, roads and bridges, among other projects. But this might be as good as it gets for Alcoa, according to analysts at Credit Suisse, who recently downgraded the stock from Outperform to Neutral. Analyst Curt Woodworth writes noted that “supply/demand balances will start to normalize” in the second half of the year. Aluminum is used in a broad range of industrial and consumer end markets, and while there appears to be support for higher aluminum prices in the near term, Alcoa on Wednesday must speak positively about the demand/supply outlook for the next several quarters to prevent Alcoa stock from losing its luster.
Tesla (TSLA) - Reports after the close, Wednesday, Apr. 20
Wall Street expects Tesla to earn $2.26 per share on revenue of $17.78 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 93 cents per share on revenue of $10.39 billion.
What to watch: Tesla shares have been one of the better performing stocks among tech, rising 30% over the past months and 20% in six months, besting the S&P 500 index in both spans. The market has applauded the company’s delivery totals in the most-recent quarter as Tesla enjoyed strong year-over-year growth. Tesla produced 305,000 vehicles and delivered 310,000 vehicles, for an annual production run-rate of roughly 1.2 million vehicles. Estimates suggests Tesla will exit 2022 with an annual run-rate of more than 2 million vehicles. This would be an impressive achievement given the increased competition not only from upstarts like Lucid (LCID) and Rivian (RIVN), but also from traditional manufacturing titans like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). While Tesla’s increased focus on its growth strategy, namely production and profit margins, have been a major factor in the company’s recent success, the company’s production and delivery guidance for 2022 will be the main driver of the stock on Wednesday.

1350.0,2013-07-08 00:00:00 UTC,Stocks at Technical Inflection Point as Earnings Await,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stocks-technical-inflection-point-earnings-await-2013-07-08,,,"Editor's Note: Todd posts his vibes in real time each day on our Buzz & Banter .
It's a new day, a new week, and for many, a new month. With the holiday stretch behind us and earnings dead ahead-starting with Alcoa ( AA ) tonight-we'll have no shortage of news to digest as we swelter into the sweet spot of the summer.
Last Wednesday, we shared a laundry list of potential catalysts that could move the market. A few of them are listed below, with updated observations.
Egypt : While there was some violence in Cairo, the baton passed between governments in a relatively smooth manner, at least thus far. Power to the people.
Greece : Over on the Aegean Island, Greek debt inspectors are ready to release the next batch of bailout loans despite warning today of an ""uncertain"" economic outlook. Still, issues remain while a desensitized global audience looks the other way.
Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ), Barclays ( BCS ) and Credit Suisse Group AG ( CS ) ratings were cut by Moody's; given the putrid price action into that news, it was more or less a non-event after the fact.
Crude popped through par ($100) on Middle East tension concerns. While crude at $50 is more economically problematic than crude at $150, in my view, Texas Tea remains elevated, trading north of $103.
Brazil was quietly down 26% this year, or 32% in USD terms, or back at 2009 levels. It's still there, virtually in the same spot; wax-off.
There were high level defections in Portugal in front of €10 billion of bonds due in September, reminiscent in some ways of what we said in September 2008 . The president is now considering a snap election in an attempt to identify a solution to the political crisis; the situation remains fluid.
Shibor concerns continue to abate as the Chinese overnight lending rate dropped from 3.38% to 3.26%, per the chart below.
For the first time in history, the SPY (NYSEARCA:SPY) opened and closed in the bottom half of its intra-day range for four straight days (Thursday to Tuesday). Typically, when a stock, market, or market of stocks opens strong and fades lower into the close, it's a sign of distribution.
Indeed, when we awoke last Wednesday, global markets were getting crushed and the stateside tape, sitting directly under our technical Danger Zone (updated below) had every excuse to trade lower-but didn't.
We offered at the time that we might be learning a lot just by watching-the reaction to news is always more important than the news itself-but some offered the thin holiday ranks skewed the traditional dynamic, if in fact the dynamic is still traditional. Still, rallies on lighter volume are typically viewed with suspicion; particularly if sell-offs occur on heavier volume.
All things considered, the next leg of the US equity market will rely on the fundamental metric, which arrives in the form of earnings. Historically, the bigger the rally into earnings, the higher the bar becomes for companies to clear those hurdles, which is what we refer to when we discuss ""field position.""
The S&P (INDEXSP:.INX) has rallied 5.5% since the June swoon low at S&P 1560 on June 24, for what it's worth and so it's said-right smack dab back into the middle of the June range. Due to the upward slope of the November trend line, my trading parameters are in constant flux and updated in real-time on the Buzz & Banter ( click here for a free two-week trial ).
Random Thoughts:
S&P 1600-1650 is the near-term zone; Mr. Valentine has set the price.
Last Friday, the ECB communicated that they would remain ""extraordinarily easy"" for an extended period (and discussed dropping the deposit rate below zero ) and the Chinese government said they would suspend the release of industry-specific data for the monthly manufacturing PMI (flashback to the suspension of US M3!). I'm sure they had no idea it was a holiday session in the US.
The jobs data? Better, if you believe the top line. The U6 unemployment -likely a truer gauge-rose to 14.3%, or one in roughly every seven people in the US are out of work.
Discipline must always trump conviction.
Gold $1180 is the level that must hold to the downside.
Bloomberg is reporting that John Paulson's PFR Gold Fund fell 23% in June and is down 65% year-to-date. The bigger question, I suppose, is whether he has been selling.
We have inflation in things we need, deflation in things we want, thus the question is posed: Do we need gold?
The Internet is the most deflationary invention of all time, which is great if you're a consumer but not so much if you're a manufacturer.
A sideways market above support is called basing; a sideways market under resistance is called churning.
We took our daughter Ruby on the water for the first time over the holiday; she's a natural!
Good luck this week, and I'll see YOU over on the Buzz!

1315.0,2013-09-10 00:00:00 UTC,What A Changing Dow Means For Investors,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-changing-dow-means-investors-2013-09-10-0,,,"We have Charles Martin Hall to thanks for many major industrial advances of the 20th century. His discovery of the process of aluminum smelting produced many breakthroughs in food services, packaging, automobiles and aerospace.
But Hall and the company he founded are no longer held in such high esteem on Wall Street.
Alcoa ( AA ) has just been asked to pick up its things and leave the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ ) and Bank of America ( BAC ) have also been shown the door.
I noted the possibility of these changes last year, predicting that Alcoa and HP were headed for the exits. I also thought Travelers ( TRV ) would be given the boot, though the ongoing troubles at Bank of America made that financial services firm more vulnerable. The fact that BofA has more than five times the market value of Travelers was apparently of little concern. (And the fact that Travelers was added to the index only four years ago likely meant that it was too soon for a change of heart anyway.)
However, my predictions regarding which companies would join the Dow were off the mark. The addition of Visa ( V ) , Nike (NKE) and Goldman Sachs (GS) suggests a clear move to boost the Dow's global exposure -- but I remain stunned that Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) is not yet a member of the Dow. A $450 billion market value and a $170 billion revenue base is pretty hard to ignore.
I'd add that Wells Fargo (WFC) , Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK) and Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) would have made worthwhile additions as well. They presumably remain on the short list when the Dow is again reshuffled in a few years.
What It Means For Investors
So how does the changing Dow affect investors? For starters, investors in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are based on the Dow, such as the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) , now have incrementally better exposure to most dynamic aspects of the U.S. economy. (Despite its myriad industrial uses, aluminum is not an especially profitable business, and HP's computers are losing relevance.)
Companies that are added to the index can also see a quick share price boost (and the bragging rights don't hurt, either). Goldman Sachs, Visa and Nike all jumped 2% to 3% on news of their inclusion. The Dow rejects, on the other hand, didn't fall at a similar pace. Investors likely saw these exits coming.
What's next?
We can assume that this group will remain constant for at least a few years, unless any Dow components get merged out of existence. Recently, the Dow's strategists have tended to only make a cluster of changes every three to four years:
1997: four companies replaced
1999: four companies replaced
2004: three companies replaced
2008: three companies replaced
2009: two companies replaced
2012: one company replaced
2013: three companies replaced
2016: ???
Frankly, that's a lot of turnover in a 16-year stretch, reflective of the rapid changes taking place in the global economy. The newly constructed Dow shows a clear reflection of the kind of companies leading the global charge these days:
Five financial services firms: American Express (AXP) , Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) , Travelers, Visa
Five technology firms: Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) , Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) , IBM (IBM) , and Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) .
Six industrial firms: 3M (MMM) , Boeing (BA) , Caterpillar (CAT) , DuPont (DD) , General Electric (GE) , and United Technologies (UTX) .
The remaining 14 firms are spread among the energy, telecom, consumer discretionary and health care sectors.
Action To Take --> There's no question that the Dow Jones Industrial Average just became a more relevant index for the U.S. economy. Yet the fact that Apple, Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) and Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) are all excluded means that the Dow planners have an outdated view of what drives the economy.
Then again, investors can gain ample exposure to these firms through Nasdaq-focused ETFs. It's smart to make sure you have exposure to both the Dow and the Nasdaq for true long-term portfolio diversification. Is the Dow or Nasdaq a better investment for the near-term? Well, roughly a month ago, I made the case that mega-caps, including many companies residing in the Dow, hold relatively strong appeal right now.

July 29 (Reuters) - European stocks hit record highs on Thursday as strong earnings from commodity majors, Airbus and a clutch of other companies set an upbeat tone, with fading concerns about China's regulatory moves also helping sentiment.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX rose 0.3% to a fresh all-time high of 463 points in morning trading.
Airbus AIR.PA jumped 3.4%, providing the biggest boost to the index, after the world's largest planemaker sharply raised its forecasts for full-year deliveries and earnings.
UK-listed Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L gained 3.5% and France's TotalEnergies TTEF.PA added 2.3% after both companies announced share buybacks as a surge in oil and gas prices boosted their earnings.

Strong quarterly earnings and optimism around European reopening put the STOXX 600 on course for its sixth straight month of gains despite lingering concerns about inflation and China's regulatory crackdown.
""Globally diversified stocks have recorded the strongest EPS beats, while consumer stocks with high emerging market exposure have recorded the weakest,"" said Milla Savova, investment strategist at BofA said in a note.
Savova, however, noted that mentions of inflation by STOXX 600 companies have risen by more than 400% over the past year, leaving them at an all-time high in absolute terms.

In the past year we’ve had a few ah-ha moments. One of them involves challenging the traditional methods of investing. Experts for ages preached owning stocks, not trading them. Now everyone is a trader as the new breed settles in. Today, the goal is to share a trading opportunity for American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock. We do this while we also describe the long-term opportunity in details.

The reopening process is going well in the United States. Those who want the vaccine got it, and there’s plenty more for the rest.
I even dined indoors at a restaurant this week in southern California. This hasn’t happened in more than a year.
The economic reports suggest that the U.S. is booming from last year’s base. This is a knife that cuts both ways, because it will bring about the end of QE faster.
The airlines, on the other hand, are struggling on many fronts. Even though travel traffic exploded relative to 2020, it is still 30% below 2019. There’s a lot more to recover before they can call it business as usual.
10 Best Stocks to Buy to Build Up Passive Income Streams
In addition, American airlines reported difficulties finding labor. My wife flew this airline six times in the last two months. Every leg was late, canceled or half empty. I’m not certain we know the whole story behind closed doors. One thing is for sure, business is definitely not as usual.
AAL Stock Upside Opportunity
Source: Chart by TradingView
This is a problem now, but it’s the opportunity later. Most often when there’s room for improvement, there is upside potential in the equity. AAL stock is at the bottom end of a broad consolidation period. It spiked 40% in January, most likely in sympathy to the shenanigans on Reddit.
Since then, the bulls and bears have been fighting it out in a clear sideways channel. There is an effort this week to stabilize and build a base at $22 per share. This is important because it’s exactly the January high when it failed miserably. This clearly is a pivotal zone and it should provide support on the way down.
Investors who are seeking a swing trade have $5 of potential upside. However, if the goal is not to hold it for a long time, it’s best to set a stop loss level below $21. Technically, losing that would trigger a bearish pattern and invite more sellers. The next level of support is strong but $2 lower.
The Long and the Short
Long term, it is a viable thesis to expect more upside than downside in AAL stock. I personally would prefer not to engage in a full size investment because of extrinsic factors. The indices are breaking records again even when we know that the end of QE is closer now.
The Federal Reserve rhetoric clearly changed. They are no longer unanimous in wanting to ignore inflation. Almost all of them now acknowledge it, yet so far, the official word is that it’s transient. I worry that they are wrong and then the stock market will have a tizzy if I’m correct.
To be cautious, I would delay taking a full-size position now. For a long-term entry, there’s no harm of waiting out a few ticks. I called it a buy from lower levels, so I am being fair and consistent with my opinion. I even marked $23 as a resistance zone on the chart back then in early February.
If the swing trade unfolds, I expect resistance going into $24 per share. The biggest catalyst will come if the bulls are able to exceed $26 per share. That’s 16% higher than current price, but it would make for one fantastic trigger. The upside of that pattern could bring it back above the pandemic accident scene.
The recovery process is going well, but the business operation of AAL stock is not. Fans should acknowledge that and infuse a bit of doubt in their bullish thesis. We have never had conditions like these before, so nobody’s an expert. We should all be more humble than usual with our conviction. If I absolutely must buy shares today then I would rather sell puts 25% lower. This way I don’t need a rally to win, and I have a huge buffer just in case.

668.0,2022-08-30 00:00:00 UTC,Why Is Alcoa (AA) Stock Down 10% Today?,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-is-alcoa-aa-stock-down-10-today,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
It’s not a good day for the stock market, for copper and aluminum futures, or for Alcoa (NYSE:AA). Regarding the last item on that list, AA stock is down almost 10% so far on Tuesday. Shares are now down three days in a row and are about 15% off Friday’s high.
Energy costs are out of control. While Americans felt that gas prices were far too explosive coming into the summer, most seem to have no idea just how bad the situation in Europe is.
Whether it’s energy prices that are sinking small- and medium-sized businesses or shutting down smelters, the problem is ballooning at a rapid and alarming rate. That’s exactly what’s happening with Alcoa right now.
Alcoa recently announced it will cut one-third of its production at its plant in Lista, Norway. This is to help with the company’s high energy costs, which pays spot energy prices at its Lista location. Specifically, its Lista site has gone up to more than $600 per megawatt hour.
Alcoa isn’t the only company to lower its production primarily due to skyrocketing energy prices. Norsk Hydro (OTCMKTS:NHYDY) plans to close its Slovakia facility by the end of September.
Not an Easy Time for AA Stock
If Alcoa and Norway sound familiar, it’s likely because the company has had a tough time lately. Alcoa faced a strike at its Mosjoen, Norway, aluminum smelter. Further, after citing “operational challenges,” the company cut production at one of its Indiana plants.
As for AA stock, the share price was performing better over the summer. However, the latest stock market correction has not been treating the stock all that well. Just a few days after hitting its 2022 low in July, Alcoa delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat. It also announced a $500 million buyback. For a company with a sub-$10 billion market capitalization, that’s no small sum.
At one point, AA stock rallied in 11 straight daily sessions earlier this quarter. In all, the stock rallied almost 50% from its July low to the summer high, but it appears all of that good fortune is at risk.
Smelting production is coming offline, there are worries about global growth, and energy prices continue to soar. Will that doom Alcoa? It’s too early to say, but clearly there are some roadblocks popping up.

Delta Air Lines DAL also grabbed the headlines following management’s decision to increase the frequency of flights to Seoul, driven by a strong rebound in international travel.
Highlighting its operational efficiency, Spirit Airlines SAVE recorded its highest-ever completion factor (% of scheduled flights that are completed) for the month of July. Per data available from Cirium, a leading aviation data analysis company, Brazilian carrier Azul AZUL emerged as the most on-time airline across the globe in July.
Recap of the Latest Top Stories
1. To modernize its fleet, American Airlines inked a deal with Boom Supersonic to purchase up to 20 Overture planes from the latter. AAL already made a non-refundable deposit for the fleet. The agreement also includes the option of buying 40 more such high-speed jets for the airline that are expected to carry passengers at twice the speed of the fastest commercial aircraft available currently. Financial details of the deal remain undisclosed.
Boom expects to start rolling out the new super-fast jets in 2025. These planes are anticipated to start ferrying passengers by 2029. They are expected to carry 65-80 passengers on every trip. AAL currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2. Spirit Airlines’ operational performance in the Jun 5-Aug 5 period, during which the airline operated more than 44,000 domestic and international flights, was excellent. The stellar performance during the busy summer season is a huge positive for SAVE. The highly-impressive conduct may help it attract additional traffic as it is likely to have pleased passengers greatly. Apart from the record July performance with respect to the completion factor, SAVE’s completion factor during the period was 99.2% (which ranked 3rd in the U.S. airline industry). In the same time frame, there were 25 days when the completion factor was 100%. During the two-month period, 77.5% of flights arrived within 14 minutes of the scheduled time.
SAVE was also in the news when it reported a narrower-than-expected loss per share for second-quarter 2022. The story was reported in detail in the previous week’s write-up.
3. To expand its network in response to buoyant air-travel demand, Delta’s management decided to increase the frequency of its nonstop service between Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Seoul-Incheon International Airport. To this end, Delta aims to introduce flights to Seoul, which will operate thrice a week from Dec 13. The new service will complement Delta’s existing daily operations and partner Korean Air’s five-times a week service. The addition implies that 15 flights per week will operate under Delta’s Seoul service.
4. Azul stated in its press release that per Cirium’s ""The Airline On-Time Performance Report"", the Brazilian carrier was the most punctual airline, globally (in terms of mainline service), in July with an on-time performance being 89.02%. The data considered 99.4% of AZUL's 25,003 flights in the month. Expressing delight at this development, the carrier’s president John Rodgerson said, ""Once again I am incredibly proud of my more than 13,000 colleagues for delivering an industry leading experience for our customers.  This is the 2nd time in the previous 5 months that we have been number 1 in the world and we have been in the top 5 in every month since March.""

Alcoa reported an actual $0.04 earnings per share on revenues of $5.6 billion in its 4th quarter, higher than the $5213 million expected by the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but two cents lower on the bottom line, a 33% negative surprise in EPS.
The company tied $1.7 billion in costs related to legacy smelting operations, and realized aluminum prices fell 7% year over year (which has been a constant bugaboo for Alcoa and other aluminum companies for the past several quarters). Further, just today Alcoa announced it has reached a settlement with the SEC and DOJ regarding bribery charges to Bahraini officials. Though these numbers do not show up in AA's fiscal 2013 report, the company has agreed to pay five installments of $161 million over the next four years.
That said, free cash flow is positive at $498 million, with $1.4 billion in cash on hand. Improved liquidity was one of Alcoa's goals for the quarter.
So while aluminum prices seem to remain a sticking point for Alcoa and others such as Rio Tinto ( RIO ), the global economic recovery looks to be underway, which should be a long-term positive for Alcoa. It would also make today's agreed-upon settlement charges go down easier to know that overall revenues will pick up once global demand for aluminum products increases.
Finally, let's not forget Alcoa marks the unofficial start of earnings season. Let the games begin!

1717.0,2011-11-21 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa Seeks Refinery Extension - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-seeks-refinery-extension-analyst-blog-2011-11-21,,,"Aluminum producer, Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) applied for a five-year extension of its environmental approval to expand its Wagerup refinery in Western Australia as the previous consent period has expired.
Alcoa suspended its proposed expansion of the Wagerup refinery in November 2008 after the global credit crisis curbed demand.
The Alcoa World Alumina & Chemical, or AWAC venture, 60% owned by Alcoa and 40% controlled by Melbourne-based Alumina, produces alumina, which is refined into aluminum, used in making aircraft and beverage cans.
Recently, Alcoa announced at its Investors Day at Davenport, Iowa, that its technology and innovative products are being positioned for profitable growth, particularly in the aerospace and automotive markets.
For rolled products Alcoa expects to add $2.5 billion to the top line by 2013. The company expects to achieve 50% to 60% of this revenue growth in 2011.
Most of the growth for Alcoa has come from the auto industry, where new fuel efficiency requirements are driving demand for lighter-weight car and truck bodies. Sales growth was also witnessed in the aerospace sector. The company's aerospace business is expected to grow by 9% over the next four to five years due, in part, to increasing build rates in the aerospace industry.
The company is targeting to boost its engineered products business, which provides specialized aluminum products for various industries. Alcoa has set a revenue growth target of $1.6 billion by 2013 and forecasts to grow 40% to 45% growth in 2011.
Alcoa is lowering its cost position in the upstream businesses to capture increased value from growing aluminum demand, while driving profitable growth in the mid- and downstream businesses through innovative products and unique partnerships.
The company expects to generate more revenue from alumina as the company moves away from London Metal Exchange pricing to a system based on alumina spot price indexes. Alcoa expects its primary metal costs to come down once its new Ma'aden smelter in Saudi Arabia comes online in 2014.
Alcoa reiterated its estimate that global demand for the lightweight metal will grow by 12% in 2011 and double by 2020, driven by strong usage in developing nations.
Like in Alcoa's other businesses, there is potential growth for the rolled products in the new emerging markets.
In October 2011, the company reported adjusted earnings of 15 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents. Adjusted earnings more than doubled from 6 cents reported in the year-ago quarter, but were 46.4% lower than the sequential quarter earnings of 28 cents due to lower metal prices, seasonal factors and weakness in Europe.
Revenues for the quarter were up 21% year over year to $6.419 billion, and were down from $6.585 billion in the sequential quarter. Alcoa's end-markets demonstrated strong revenue growth, on a year-over-year basis whereas, sequentially the company experienced mixed market conditions.
Revenue was lower for both alumina and aluminum, down 5% and 1%, respectively, driven by lower alumina shipments and lower realized pricing in both businesses. In the end-markets, revenue increased in commercial transportation (6%) and aerospace (2%), while declines were seen in automotive (7%), industrial products (6%), building and construction (5%), and packaging (4%).
The company's adjusted EBITDA was $821 million, up 36% from third quarter 2010, but down 21% from second quarter 2011.
Currently, Alcoa has a short-term (1 to 3 months) Zacks #5 Strong S4ell rating and a long-term (6 months) Neutral recommendation.
Alcoa faces stiff competition from Aluminum Corporation Of China Limited ( ACH ) or Chalco.

R is benefiting from strong rental demand and favorable pricing. The company’s measures to reward its shareholders are encouraging.
Against this backdrop, let’s look at the factors that make this stock an attractive pick.
What Makes Ryder an Attractive Pick?
An Outperformer: A glimpse at the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse over the past six months. Shares of Ryder have gained 34.1% over the past six months, outperforming the 22.1% rise of the industry it belongs to.

Solid Rank & VGM Score: Ryder currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best investment opportunities. Thus, the company seems to be an appropriate investment proposition at the moment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Northward Estimate Revisions: The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ryder’s first-quarter 2023 earnings has moved up 1% year over year. For 2023 and 2024, the company’s earnings are expected to increase 2.9% and 18.2%, year over year, respectively. 
Positive Earnings Surprise History: Ryder has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company delivered an earnings surprise of 21.81% in the last four quarters, on average.
Growth Factors: Ryder is benefiting from improving economic and freight conditions in the United States. Revenues at all segments grew (on higher rental revenues, new business and favorable pricing) in the fourth quarter of 2022. Ryder’s 2023 outlook is encouraging. For 2023, Ryder expects total revenues and operating revenues to increase 2% and 4%, respectively.
Adjusted EPS is estimated to be between $11.05 and $12.05. Ryder’s efforts to reward its shareholders bode well. In February 2022, the company entered a $300-million accelerated share buyback program. In July 2022, Ryder announced a 7% hike in its quarterly dividend, taking the total to 62 cents per share (annualized $2.48).

Additionally, the company repurchased 0.9 million shares for $78 million under its 2021 Anti-Dilutive program.

Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

2329.0,2023-08-21 00:00:00 UTC,Thungela profit tumbles on lower coal prices and rail woes,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/thungela-profit-tumbles-on-lower-coal-prices-and-rail-woes,,,"By Felix Njini
NAIROBI, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Thungela Resources TGAJ.J, South Africa's largest shipper of coal burned in power stations, suffered a 69% drop in first-half profit, hit by lower prices and transportation problems, it said on Monday.
The Johannesburg-based thermal coal producer spun off from Anglo American AAL.L in 2021 added that it could be forced to ""structurally resize the portfolio in response to rail constraints"".
Thungela said it has about 2.7 million metric tons of coal stockpiled at its mines due to state-owned rail operator Transnet SOC's inability to move sufficient coal to ports.
""Depending on the trajectory of Transnet's improvement or worsening thereof and the forward curve of prices, it could require us to further review the size and shape of our portfolio,"" Thungela CEO July Ndlovu said on a conference call. He did not elaborate.
Freight rail capacity problems in South Africa are also forcing producers such as Exxaro ResourcesEXXJ.J, Kumba Iron Ore KIOJ.J to build stockpiles at their mines as they struggle to move the minerals to ports.
Ndlovu declined to provide production guidance for 2024. Output this year is forecast at between 11.5 million tons and 12.5 million tons.
""We need to see in the remainder of the year where this is landing us and that will allow us to decide on where our production is going to be in 2024,"" Ndlovu said.
Freight rail capacity problems in South Africa are also forcing other coal and iron ore producers such as Exxaro Resources EXXJ.J and Kumba Iron Ore KIOJ.J to build stockpiles at their mines as they struggle to move the minerals to ports.

413.0,2023-10-13 00:00:00 UTC,"Big Banks Beat in Q3, Import Prices Lower",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/big-banks-beat-in-q3-import-prices-lower,,,"It’s the unofficial start to Q3 earnings season with the morning releases of some of the biggest banks on Wall Street. In truth, we’ve been seeing Q3 reports come in dribs and drabs previously this week and before. Traditionally, earnings season didn’t kick off until Alcoa AA reported, but they’re not scheduled until next Wednesday. In any case, we’re happy we’re here; we can finally get a good glimpse at how the past quarter went, and how the full year is expected to finish.

Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated JPMorgan Chase JPM posted Q3 earnings of $4.33 per share, nicely surpassing the $3.89 in the Zacks consensus for an +11.3% positive earnings surprise — and its fifth-straight bottom-line beat. Revenues of $39.87 billion in the quarter outperformed expectations by +1.9%, helping solidify its leadership status of the biggest Wall Street banks. For more on JPM’s earnings, click here.

Citigroup C also beat estimates on both top and bottom lines this morning for its Q3, with earnings of $1.63 per share coming in ahead of the $1.26 analysts were looking for on $20.4 billion in quarterly revenues, which surpassed the $19.32 billion anticipated. Both Institutional and Wealth Management outperformed expectations in the quarter, and shares are up +2.6% on the news.

Wells Fargo WFC made it a trifecta this morning, outpacing expectations on both earnings and revenues. The company reported $1.39 per share — nicely above the $1.25 Zacks consensus and the $1.30 per share posted in the previous year’s quarter. Revenues of $20.86 billion in the quarter beat estimates by a cool +3.18%. Shares are up +2.4% in pre-market trading at this hour, nearly bring shares back to break-even for the year. For more on WFC’s earnings, click here.

The September Import Price Index this morning came in well below expectations: +0.1% versus +0.5% consensus, which was also the previous month’s print. It’s the smallest move on import prices since June. Stripping out volatile petrol (fuel oil/gasoline), this figure drops to -0.3% — lower than the -0.1% anticipated and the lowest result since June of 2022. Year over year came in -1.7% for the eighth straight down-month. It’s worse than the -1.4% expected, but the closest to break-even since February.

Exports came in +0.7% month over month. Its -4.1% year over year is pretty much in-line with analyst expectations, and an improvement from the downwardly revised -5.7% the previous month. This is the sixth-straight month lower on export prices, year over year. After today’s open, we’ll see Consumer Sentiment for October, expected to tick down to 67.4 from 68.1 reported last month.

2596.0,2023-05-12 00:00:00 UTC,Here's Why Investors May Bet on American Airlines (AAL) Stock,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/heres-why-investors-may-bet-on-american-airlines-aal-stock,,,"American Airlines AAL is gaining from an uptick in air-travel demand (particularly on the leisure front). The upsurge in passenger volumes makes the AAL stock an interesting investment opportunity.
Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors working in favor of the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.
Northward Earnings Estimates: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter and current-year earnings has been revised 45.4% and 29.4% upward, over the past 60 days, respectively. Such favorable estimate revisions reflect brokers’ confidence in the stock.
Given the wealth of information at the brokers’ disposal, it is in the best interest of investors to be guided by their expert advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. This is because it serves as a key indicator in determining the price of a stock.
Upbeat Air-travel Demand: American Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand.
Owing to upbeat air-travel demand, operating revenues in first-quarter 2023 increased 37% year over year. Passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line (91.1%), increased to $11,103 million from $7,818 million a year ago. To match the high demand, AAL is increasing capacity. 
AAL expects system capacity for the June-end quarter to increase 3.5-5.5% from the second-quarter 2022 reported level. Management projects second-quarter 2023 earnings per share (excluding net special items) between $1.20 and $1.40. AAL estimates 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.50-$3.50.
Impressive Price Performance: Driven by the rosy air-travel demand scenario, shares of AAL  have gained10.6% year to date compared with its industry’s appreciation of 6.1% in the same timeframe.
 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
 Bullish Industry Rank: The industry, to which AAL belongs, currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 37 (of 250 plus groups). Such a solid rank places the company at the top 15% of the Zacks industries. Studies show that 50% of a stock price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group that it hails from.
An ordinary stock in a strong group is likely to outperform a robust stock in a weak industry. Therefore, taking the industry’s performance into consideration becomes imperative.
Other Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry may also consider stocks like Copa Holdings CPA and United Airlines UAL, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Copa Holdings is benefiting from an improvement in air-travel demand. In first-quarter 2023, passenger revenues increased 28.5% from first-quarter 2019 levels due to higher yields.
CPA’s focus on its cargo segment is encouraging. In first-quarter 2023, cargo and mail revenues grew 51.8% from the comparable quarter of 2019 on higher cargo volumes and yields. Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s current-year earnings has been revised 6.15% upward over the past 60 days.
United Airlines is seeing steady recovery in domestic and international air-travel demand. Owing to robust air-travel demand, UAL expects revenues for the June-end quarter to grow 14-16% year over year.
For 2023, United Airlines expects capacity to be in the high teens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 9% upward in the past 60 days.

999.0,2021-08-20 00:00:00 UTC,Why Shares of Major Metals and Mining Stocks Melted This Week,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-shares-of-major-metals-and-mining-stocks-melted-this-week-2021-08-20,,,"What happened
It's turning out to be a nerve-wracking week for metals and mining stocks, with many breaking their winning streak that started this year and falling precipitously. Here's how some of the largest stocks from the sector are performing as of 1:45 p.m. EDT Friday:
BHP Group (NYSE: BHP): Down 18.9%.
Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX): Down 14.2%.
Vedanta (NYSE: VEDL): Down 17.5%.
Alcoa (NYSE: AA): Down 17%.
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (NYSE: SID): Down: 15.8%.
There's a common link between all these stocks: They're industrial metals producers, dealing in base metals, which also explains why they're tumbling.
So what
The meteoric rise in metals stocks this year can be attributed to surging prices of metals. But wait, that's an understatement: Prices of iron ore, copper, steel, and aluminum, in fact, hit record highs some weeks ago. Here's a quick overview of the metals and materials the five stocks primarily deal in.
STOCK PRIMARY PRODUCT
Alcoa Aluminum
BHP Iron ore, copper, nickel, metallurgical coal
Freeport-McMoRan Copper
Vedanta Iron ore, zinc, copper, lead, steel
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional Steel
Data source: Company presentations. Table by author.
Strong demand from the world's top metals consumer, China, propped up prices even as the reopening of global economies after last year's COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns and expectations of an infrastructure bill under the Biden administration offered support. With governments also pumping trillions of dollars into stimulus packages, demand for commodities shot up.
Within months, several mining stocks were earning their highest profits and cash flows ever, reducing debt aggressively and doling out bumper dividends.
Image source: Getty Images.
Alcoa, for example, reported its highest-ever quarterly profit in July since becoming an upstream aluminum company after its split in 2016. Its numbers fueled several analyst upgrades on Alcoa shares. Vedanta, the India-based diversified oil and gas and metals company, generated a record quarterly profit in its last quarter as well.
This week, BHP reported record free cash flow worth $19.4 billion for its financial year ended June 30, 2021 and announced its highest-ever final dividend of $2 per share. With that, BHP returned a whopping $15 billion to shareholders in just the past year. BHP is now also about to sell its petroleum business in a multi-billion dollar deal, which should shore up its cash balance even more.
Freeport-McMoRan isn't too far behind. Earlier in the year, it adopted a fixed-and-variable hybrid dividend policy under which it aims to pay out an annual base dividend of $0.30 per share and a variable dividend on top of that once the company achieves a net debt target of $3 billion to $4 billion. By the end of June, the copper giant had already hit a net debt of $3.4 billion.
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, the largest integrated steel producer in Brazil, also hit its net debt target last quarter as its cash flows hit a quarterly record.
So why are these stocks plummeting this week despite such impressive operational performances?
BHP data by YCharts.
Unfortunately, prices of base industrial metals are sinking almost as swiftly as they surged. Picture this: On August 19, iron ore prices slumped to eight-month lows, dropping almost 40% from their record highs in May, dragging steel prices along as steel is made from iron ore. Copper prices too are hitting six-month lows even as I write this.
Metal prices fell primarily because of developments in China. The country's industrial production grew at a much slower pace than anticipated in June, triggering fears about decelerating growth. Its steel output has now declined for two consecutive months as the nation is slapping production controls to curb pollution.
Meanwhile, fears of the Federal Reserve tapering bond purchases are also weighing down on metal prices as reducing bond-buying typically boosts the U.S. dollar, making dollar-priced commodities like metals more expensive for buyers from outside the U.S.
In short, the performance of cyclical, commodity stocks largely follows commodity prices, and that's exactly what's happening with metals and mining stocks right now.
Now what
The sky-high prices of metals weren't sustainable, but prices should stabilize. Aluminum and copper are more sought after than ever given their use in lightweight, electric vehicles, while iron ore and steel are key raw materials used in construction, which makes for a compelling investing proposition under Biden.
Most importantly, many of these mining stocks are much better placed to ride out the cyclicality now that they're flush with cash and have strengthened their balance sheets significantly in recent months. That's something investors may want to keep in mind before dumping their shares in fear.

2107.0,2023-11-14 00:00:00 UTC,U.S. Airlines Set to Soar This Thanksgiving Travel Period,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/u.s.-airlines-set-to-soar-this-thanksgiving-travel-period,,,"It is a well-documented fact that air travel demand has bounced back strongly from the pandemic lows. Driven by buoyant passenger volumes, the upcoming Thanksgiving travel period (Nov 17-27) is expected to be a very busy one for U.S. airlines.
Upbeat traffic volumes during the Labor Day holiday weekend earlier this year further highlight the encouraging scenario. Therefore, we believe that investors interested in the industry would do well to keep U.S. airline stocks like United Airlines UAL, American Airlines AAL and Delta Air Lines DAL on their radar.

The abovementioned stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here

Following the removal of coronavirus-induced restrictions, pent-up demand has been driving traffic for the airlines. Despite inflationary pressures and the resultant high interest rates, there is a wave of optimism in the United States surrounding air travel demand.
To meet the anticipated demand swell, U.S. airlines are boosting capacity (airlines are offering 253,000 more seats per day during the period) despite challenges like high labor and fuel costs. These headwinds are unlikely to have a significant adverse impact on passenger volumes in the Thanksgiving period, as people are eager to travel after being confined to their homes during the pandemic.
Per A4A, air travel during the Thanksgiving holiday period this year is likely to touch an all-time high. Passenger volume is expected to be nearly 30 million over the 11-day period. The forecast implies that 2.7 million passengers are likely to fly per day, a 9% increase from 2022 actuals. Per the projection, the Sunday after Thanksgiving, Nov 26, is likely to be the busiest day of the 11-day holiday period. A record 3.2 million passengers are expected to take to the skies on that day.

Moreover, the prevalence of remote working is expected to ease the congestion with respect to air travel this year as it helps many people travel on days when the rush is likely to be relatively less, and air tickets are comparatively cheaper.
Delta expects approximately 6 million passengers to avail its flights in the Nov 18-29 timeframe. The forecast implies that nearly 50,000 passengers are likely to fly per day. Management believes that Delta’s peak travel days are expected to be the Friday before Thanksgiving (and the Sunday following the holiday).  American Airlines expects the busiest-ever Thanksgiving travel period. Management expects that more than 7.8 million passengers will avail of its flights in the Nov 16-Nov 28 timeframe.
Like AAL, United Airlines expects the busiest-ever Thanksgiving travel period. The Sunday after Thanksgiving is expected to be the busiest in terms of air traffic. Management expects 5.9 million passengers to board its flights over the 11-day Thanksgiving travel period.

1338.0,2013-07-10 00:00:00 UTC,July 10: Is Tapering No Longer a Hurdle for Stocks? - Economic Highlights,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/july-10%3A-is-tapering-no-longer-a-hurdle-for-stocks-economic-highlights-2013-07-10,,,"Stocks are within striking distance of reclaiming the all-time high reached less than two months back, with the pullback resulting concerns that the Fed was getting ready to pare back its QE program. We will get more clarity on the Fed question this afternoon with the release of the minutes of the Fed's June meeting. Also at play in today's session are renewed concerns about China's growth outlook after another weak economic reading - this time about that country's exports.
The stock market's ability to claw back its losses over the last few weeks despite the persistent rise in benchmark treasury yields, is very impressive. My sense is that these gains will prove sustainable only if they reflect investors' collective judgment that an improved economic outlook trumps less Fed QE and somewhat higher interest rates. But if the market's gains reflect the hope that 'Tapering' was not imminent, then we may be at risk of giving all of these back in the coming days.
I continue to believe that U.S. economic outlook was stable enough to allow the Fed to start pulling back from its QE program later this year. A number of Fed officials went out of their way to dial back Bernanke's fairly explicit pronouncements on the 'Taper' question. But the bond market got it right from the get go, pushing 10-year treasury yields by almost 100 basis points since early May. This afternoon's minutes of the June FOMC meeting will likely confirm that Bernanke's comments were more in-line with the emerging majority on the committee.
With respect to China's growth outlook, Alcoa ( AA ) appeared to be reassuringly explicit in its earnings release on Monday, belying concerns raised by a host of weak economic readings in recent days. But today's official export numbers run counter to Alcoa's claims and raise further doubts about that country's picture. The decline in Chinese exports in June, the first in a non-holiday month since late 2009, is likely not a one-off event and likely reflective of some loss of competitiveness for China's export sector. Competitiveness has suffered to some extent relative to lower wage regional countries like Vietnam as a result of rising wages and unfavorable exchange rate movements. The continued economic problems in Europe also remain a headwind, as the more than 8% drop in exports to Europe reconfirm.
The China growth question magnifies similar concerns about the rest of the emerging world as the recent growth downgrade by the IMF shows. The China issue will figure prominently in the Yum Brand' s ( YUM ) earnings release later today as well, though YUM is dealing with a number of company-specific issues that are not directly tied to China's growth outlook.
But the fact remains that a big part of the expected earnings growth in the second half of the 2013 and full year 2014 for the S&P 500 as a whole is contingent on improved economic growth beyond the U.S. borders. For context, keep in mind that consensus earnings expectations are looking for earnings growth to accelerate from the first-half 2013's less than +3% pace to more than +9% rate in the second half and accelerate even further to more than +11% in 2014. With more than 40% of S&P 500 earnings coming from international markets, those growth expectations will likely need to be scaled back

Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Citigroup (C)
Source: TungCheung / Shutterstock.com
Citigroup (NYSE:C) is the world’s leading banking group with approximately 200 million customers and a presence in more than 160 countries. C stock dipped 20% year-to-date following a difficult Q1 2022 macro backdrop that weighed on Citi’s capital market activity and a $1.5 billion reserve build to prepare for losses linked to its exposure in Russia.
Citi’s top-line growth is expected to flatten this year, posting a marginal revenue increase of 0.8% to $72.4 million, but should expand faster in 2023, up 3% to $74.6 billion. On the other side, after increasing robustly in 2021, up 103.5% to $20.7 billion, net profit is estimated to shrink 35.9% this year to $13.3 billion, offering a double-digit profit margin of 18.4% over the year.
The banking giant is an undervalued blue-chip stock that investors should consider buying on its dip. C stock has a low forward price-book ratio of only 0.5x and exchanges 7.66x 2022e P/E. Besides, analysts offer an average target price of $65.41 per share on Citi’s shares, representing an upside of more than 26% and Citigroup is expected to deliver an expected dividend yield of 4% in 2022.
Goldman Sachs (GS)

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is the second-largest investment bank in the world and is another undervalued blue-chip stock to buy now. GS stock plunged nearly 20% since the beginning of the year as the rapidly evolving equity market environment contracted GS’s Asset Management and Investment Banking activities.
Goldman Sachs’ financials are on a decelerating path, as net sales are projected to decrease 19.2% to $47.95 billion in 2022, before rebounding 3.3% to $49.5 billion in 2023. Net income is expected to shrink more rapidly this year, down 36% to $13.53 billion, and should remain relatively flat in 2023, up 1.8% to $13.78 billion. However, GS’ profitability remains robust, with an estimated profit margin of 28.2% this year, down 740 basis points compared to 2021.
However, the investment firm trades at a fair valuation, posting a 2022e P/B ratio of 1.01x and a cheap forward P/E of 8.07x, providing an opportunity for long-term investors. In addition, the average target price offered by Wall Street analysts stands at $419.42 per share, a compelling upside of 35%.
Alcoa (AA)
Source: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com
Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is an industry leader in the production of bauxite, alumina and aluminum products. AA stock outperformed the equity market since the beginning of the year, losing just 2% amid surging commodity prices.
The commodity specialist is expected to grow significantly this year. Revenues are estimated to expand 18.4% year on year to $14.39 billion in 2022, whereas net profit is forecasted to jump 394% to $2.12 billion. With this rapid increase, AA’s profit margin should reach a double-digit figure of 14.7% in 2022 versus only 3.53% last year.
In addition, Alcoa had a net cash position of $120 million at the end of 2021, which is expected to surge to $1.34 billion, a positive development given rising interest rates. The aluminum giant has cheap multiples, trading at 5.92x forward P/E and only 2.36x 2022e EV/EBITDA.
AA is one of the most affordable stocks on our undervalued blue-chip stocks list that can deliver strong gains in the long term. The stock has an upside potential of 73% according to the consensus of analysts.
Undervalued Blue-Chip Stocks: Moderna (MRNA)

Revenues skyrocketed to $18.47 billion in 2021, up 2,200% year-on-year, and should continue to advance this year, up 18.8% to $21.94 billion. MRNA’s net profits are however expected to slow, down 5.9% to $11.4 billion in 2022, representing a comfortable profit margin of 52.4% over the year.
While the company might continue to see selling pressure in the short term, MRNA stock has low multiples, posting a forward EV/EBITDA of 2.85x and 2022e P/E ratio of 5.23x. At this price, investors looking to enter a biotech giant should consider investing in this undervalued blue-chip stock.
Occidental Petroleum (OXY)
Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is one of the largest oil producers in the U.S., with a leading position in the Permian, DJ basins, and the offshore Gulf of Mexico. OXY shares soared 121% year-to-date, outperforming most of its oil peers and the broader equity market.
Despite this strong performance, tight oil markets should continue to sustain the stock. Occidental’s net sales advanced robustly in 2021, up 61.8% to $26.3 billion, and are expected to continue on a robust pace in 2022, up 28.7% to $33.8 billion. Besides, OXY’s bottom line should enhance significantly this year, with net income estimated to increase 471.1% to $8.69 billion, representing a high-profit margin of 25.7% per year.
OXY’s net debt stood at $26.8 billion in 2021, representing a leverage ratio of 1.78x, nevertheless, the oil stock is expected to reduce net debt by 43.4% this year to $15.1 billion, allowing the firm to solidify its balance sheet
With these robust fundamentals, the oil specialist exchanges at a low price, posting a forward EV/EBITDA of only 3.61x and a 2022e P/E ratio of 7.18x. However, the upside on Occidental’s equity story remains limited, with an average target price of $69.47 per share.
Micron Technology (MU)

Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) specializes in the design, manufacturing, and marketing of semiconductors. MU’s products include memory products (dynamic memories, flash memories, etc.) and semiconductor systems. Since the beginning of the year, MU stock shrank 22%, underperforming its sector and the equity market.
The company is a strong candidate in our list of undervalued blue-chip stocks, due to its weak valuation multiples and improving bottom line. After growing rapidly in 2021, up 29.3% to $27.7 billion, revenues are expected to expand by another 21.7% to $33.7 billion this year. Net income is projected to balloon 76.5% this year to $10.3 billion, offering an elevated profit margin of 30.7% per year.
The correction seen on MU stock has created an opportunity to enter this undervalued semiconductor stock that exchanges at 3.85x forward EV/EBITDA and only 7.84x 2022e P/E. In addition, the consensus of analysts offers a strong upside for the semiconductor specialist, delivering a target price of $114.69 per share, corresponding to an appreciation potential of more than 60%.

Source: 360b / Shutterstock.com
Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) is a premier global leader in the production of copper and gold, with mines in the United States, Peru, Chile, Indonesia and the Congo. FCX stock is down 16% on the year.
FCX’s revenues increased robustly last year, up 60.9% to $22.8 billion, and are projected to continue to lift at a double digit-rate, up 18.2% to $27 billion. On the other side, net income posted a steeper advance last year, lifting 618.9% to $4.3 billion and is estimated to appreciate by 30.8% to $5.63 billion. With these robust fundamentals, Freeport’s profit margin is expected to grow from 18.8% in 2021 to 20.9%, providing tailwinds to copper stock.
Freeport is a great hedge against inflation, as copper is one of the most used metals to gauge economic activity. In addition, the undervalued blue-cheap stock exchanges at a low 2022e EV/EBITDA of 4.31x and a forward P/E of 9.77x, making it a great long-term investment. The upside potential is also attractive, as analysts offer an average target price of $51.23 per share, corresponding to an appreciation potential of more than 42%.

3626.0,2022-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,Is a Beat in the Cards for Ryder (R) This Earnings Season?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-a-beat-in-the-cards-for-ryder-r-this-earnings-season,,,"Ryder System, Inc. R is slated to release first-quarter 2022 earnings numbers on Apr 27, before market open.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings has been revised upward marginally to $2.38 in the past 60 days. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average being 57.5%.
Let’s take a look at the factors that are expected to have influenced the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.
Ryder System, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Ryder System, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Ryder System, Inc. Quote
 New business, favorable pricing and higher volumes might have aided the company’s Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS) segment revenues. Per the consensus mark, the metric rose 19.3% from the first-quarter 2021 reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) segment also suggests a 26.3% increase from the prior-year quarter’s reported number.
Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, total revenues in the Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) segment   indicate a rise of 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. The uptick can be attributed to higher rental, ChoiceLease and SelectCare revenues and increased fuel pricing.
A rise in gross capital expenditures (due to higher planned investments in the rental fleet) might have dented R’s first-quarter 2022 results. High fuel costs also might have dented the bottom-line performance.
Earnings Whispers
Our proven Zacks model predicts an earnings beat for Ryder in the first quarter of 2022. This is because the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is precisely the case here. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Earnings ESP: Ryder has an Earnings ESP of +5.04% as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $2.50, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at $2.38. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Zacks Rank: Ryder carries a Zacks Rank #2.
Highlights of Q4 Earnings
Ryder’s fourth-quarter 2021 earnings (excluding 17 cents from non-recurring items) of $3.52 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.49. The bottom line increased significantly year over year on higher revenues. Total revenues of $2,600 million also outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,462.4 million. The top line increased 17.5% year over year on strong segmental performances.
Other Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the broader Transportation sector can also consider stocks like United Parcel Service UPS, Southwest Airlines LUV and American Airlines Group AAL, as these stocks too possess the right combination of elements to beat estimates this reporting cycle.
UPS has an Earnings ESP of +1.92% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked stock at present. UPS will release first-quarter 2022 results on Apr 26.
Strong package delivery demand is expected to have aided UPS’ first-quarter 2022 performance. Higher revenue per piece is likely to get reflected in U.S. Domestic Package revenues.
Southwest Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +28.09% and is currently a #3 Ranked player. LUV will release first-quarter 2022 results on Apr 28.
Southwest Airlines expects first-quarter 2022 operating revenues to decline 8-10% from the first quarter of 2019. The company expects to incur a loss in the period.
American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +3.01% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked stock at present. AAL will release first-quarter 2022 results on Apr 21.
With air-travel demand steadily rebounding, AAL’s passenger revenues are expected to reflect a significant year-over-year increase. The anticipated increase in passenger revenues is likely to have driven the company’s top line in the first quarter.

3036.0,2023-01-06 00:00:00 UTC,3 Standout Relative Price Strength Stocks to Buy for 2023,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-standout-relative-price-strength-stocks-to-buy-for-2023,,,"As we step into 2023, it is time to focus on good investment opportunities.

Last year was a tough one for Wall Street. In particular, the S&P 500 — which tracks the biggest U.S.-listed companies — closed down around 20% in 2022. It was the benchmark’s worst performance in more than a decade and ended a three-year winning streak.

With market participants concerned that the American central bank’s rate-hiking campaign to fight persistently high inflation would trigger an eventual recession, the major U.S. equity indices were caught up in a selloff even as the war between Russia and Ukraine continued to drag on.

Even now, the picture is quite mixed. While the Fed’s scaled-back rate hike of 50 basis points, following four back-to-back increases of 75 basis points each, provided a much-needed respite to the economy, softness in consumer spending, worries over a tight labor market and the lowering of this year’s GDP to 0.5% from the previous estimate of 1.2%, played spoilsport.

In the current jittery market environment, investors who might want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.
Relative Price Strength Strategy
Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is essential to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.

Upon such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.

However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands.
 
Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 for 1 to 3 months at least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.

Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.
Screening Parameters
Relative % Price change – 12 weeks greater than 0

Relative % Price change – 4 weeks greater than 0

Relative % Price change – 1 week greater than 0

(We have considered those stocks that have been outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 12 weeks, four weeks and one week.)

% Change (Q1) Est. over 4 Weeks greater than 0: Positive current-quarter estimate revisions over the last four weeks.

Zacks Rank equal to 1: Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks — that have returned more than 26% annually over the last 26 years and surpassed the S&P 500 in 23 of the last 26 years — can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Current Price greater than or equal to $5 and Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: A minimum price of $5 is a good standard to screen low-priced stocks, while a high trading volume would imply adequate liquidity.

VGM Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.

Here are the three stocks that made it through the screen:

American Airlines Group AAL: The largest airline internationally, American Airlines’ primary business is to provide passenger and cargo services. The 2022 Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Fort Worth, TX-based carrier indicates 97.9% year-over-year earnings per share growth. AAL has a VGM Score of B.

American Airlines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.6%, on average. AAL stock has lost 27.5% in a year.

Titan Machinery TITN: The company is an agricultural and construction equipment retailer in the United States and Europe. The fiscal 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate for this West Fargo, ND-based firm indicates 61.7% year-over-year earnings per share growth. TITN has a VGM Score of B.

Titan Machinery beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 59.9%, on average. TITN shares have gained 19.9% in a year.

DCP Midstream Partners DCP: This leading energy infrastructure firm has a diversified portfolio of gathering, logistics, marketing, and processing assets. DCP Midstream has a VGM Score of A. Over the past 60 days, Denver, CO-based DCP saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 move up 14%.

DCP Midstream beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 25.5%. Valued at around $8 billion, DCP has gained 35.2% in a year.

MOSCOW, May 12 (Reuters) - Russia's Alrosa ALRS.MM, the world's largest producer of rough diamonds, said on Wednesday its April sales of rough and polished stones rose by 12% month-on-month to $401 million after demand for diamond jewellery strengthened in the main markets.
Global demand for precious stones has been recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic since the second half of 2020.
Sales by the state-controlled company totalled $1.6 billion for the first four months of 2021. At the height of the pandemic in April 2020, Alrosa's sales were only $15.6 million. They rose to $357 million in March this year.
Alrosa, which competes with Anglo American AAL.L unit De Beers, is gradually restoring its production after last year's 22% reduction. It plans to return to its usual annual output of 36-37 million carats within 2-3 years from 31-32 million carats in 2021.
Rough diamonds account for the bulk of Alrosa's sales, although it polishes those of rare colours or of large size for sale in auctions.
""Our April sales were well supported by the successful results delivered by auctions of high-quality large rough, as well as by strong sales of polished diamonds,"" Evgeny Agureev, its deputy chief executive, said in a statement.
A 100.94 carat stone called the Alrosa Spectacle - the largest polished diamond ever cut in Russia - will be auctioned by Christie's in Geneva on Wednesday.

Oct 27 (Reuters) - Global miner Anglo American AAL.L said on Thursday its third-quarter output was broadly in line with last year, as a drop in copper production offset a ramp up in coal operations and strong performance at its De Beers diamond unit.
In the quarter ended Sept. 30, production of rough diamonds rose 4% year-on-year to 9.6 million carats, supported by higher grades in Botswana, while copper production dipped 6% on lower grades at the group's operations in Chile.
Steel-making coal production jumped 28% to 5.5 million tonnes as the group ramped up longwall operations at its underground mines in Grosvenor and Aquila.
Demand for rough diamonds has risen this year as gold and diamonds from Russia went off-limits due to western sanctions against Russian companies, including Alrosa ALRS.MM, the world's largest producer of rough diamonds that competes with Anglo American's unit De Beers.
Anglo American's quarterly output grew 16% from the previous three months led by the robust coal and diamond operations.
The group reiterated its annual production outlook for diamonds but flagged that sales in the fourth quarter could be hit by closure of cutting and polishing factories for holidays in India.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.8%, 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
The FOMC minutes for the Fed November meeting released in the week reaffirmed that the central bank anticipates a slower pace of interest rate hikes in the coming months. Stocks did well on the news even as the volume of trade was low because of Thanksgiving. Strong earnings numbers coming in from the retail sector also lifted investor mood.
Consumer spending usually goes up during the holiday season. Coupled with the fact that the Fed would not be squeezing demand as it has been recently, investors are optimistic about a strong end to the year. However, global macroeconomic factors like the Ukraine situation and the Covid-related unrest in China remain concerns.
Regardless of market conditions, we, here at Zacks, provide investors with unbiased guidance on how to beat the market.  
As usual, Zacks Research guided investors over the past three months with its time-tested methodologies. Given the prevailing market uncertainty, you may want to look at our feats to prepare better for your next action.
Here are some of our key achievements:
Tenaris, Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico Surge Following Zacks Rank Upgrade
Shares of Tenaris S.A. TS have surged 17.3% since it was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on September 13.

Shares of International Seaways, Inc. INSW and California BanCorp CALB have gained 32% and 16.4% since their Zacks Recommendation was upgraded to Outperform on September 16 and September 13, respectively.

However, just like the Zacks Rank, the foundation for the Zacks Recommendation is trends in earnings estimate revisions.
The Zacks Recommendation classifies stocks into three groups — Outperform, Neutral and Underperform. While these recommendations are determined quantitatively, our analysts have the flexibility to override them for the 1100+ stocks they closely follow based on their better judgment of factors such as valuation, industry conditions and management effectiveness than the quantitative model.

SAF, made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and animal fat, at present accounts for only a miniscule amount of overall jet fuel use. The group declined to comment Wednesday.

NXPI expanded its i.MX 9 series of application processors with the addition of i.MX 95 family processors.
The i.MX 95 family processors include immersive Arm Mali powered 3D graphics, high-performance and multi-core compute, and NXP eIQ Neutron Neural Processing Unit.
The latest processors incorporate a secure enclave for seamless implementation of security critical functions. The processors also implement NXP’s Energy Flex architecture to let developers run real-time safety domain at all times for sensor data monitoring.
By combining the i.MX 95 family processors with its expertise in functional safety, high-performance CPU cores and high-throughput connectivity, NXP aims to set a standard for safe and secure edge platforms.

NXP Semiconductors N.V. Price and Consensus
  NXP Semiconductors N.V. price-consensus-chart | NXP Semiconductors N.V. Quote
Growing i.MX Application Processors Portfolio
NXP is consistently bringing efficient and reliable portfolio of i.MX applications processors used for various multi-media and display applications. The recent introduction of i.MX 95 family processors is a step forward in this direction.
Apart from the recent launch, the company unveiled the i.MX 93 family of application processors that use machine learning for automotive, smart home, smart building and smart factory applications.
Further, it expanded the EdgeVerse portfolio with i.MX 8ULP, Microsoft Azure Sphere-certified i.MX 8ULP-CS and i.MX 9 applications processors to enhance security, as well as energy efficiency.
We expect the expansion of its portfolio of i.MX application processors to be the key factor behind NXP’s growth in the days ahead.
This, in turn, will help NXPI win the confidence of the investors in the near term and the long haul.
Shares of NXP have lost 29.7% in the past year, outperforming the Computer and Technology sector’s decline of 33.4%.
Booming Application Processors' Prospects
NXP’s strength in the i.MX application processors will continue to help it capitalize in the growing prospects in the application processor market.
Per a MMR report, the global application processor market is expected to reach $38.7 billion by 2027, witnessing a CAGR of 6.7% between 2022 and 2027.
According to an imarc report, the same market is likely to hit $44.3 billion by 2028 from $35.2 billion in 2022, seeing a CAGR of 3.8% during the 2023-2028 period.
Though NXPI’s strengthening efforts toward application processors remain a positive, the coronavirus pandemic-induced supply-chain constraint and mounting expenses continue to remain major headwinds.

We got another new record high in the S&P 500 as stocks continue to march higher ahead of earnings season. Now, let’s look at a few top stock trades going into next week.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 1: Boeing (BA)

Shocker: Boeing (NYSE:BA) has more negative news about its 737 MAX jet, which is causing some selling pressure in the stock.
As a result, shares are breaking below the 61.8% retracement, as well as last week’s low. If Boeing loses the $245 level, it could create some selling pressure down toward the 10-week and 50-day moving averages, around $237 to $240.
Below that, and $232 is on the table, followed by the 100-day moving average.

On the upside, though, a two-times weekly-up rotation would negate all of this bearish talk — propelling BA stock over the last two weeks worth of highs and the 100-week moving average. Above that, and Boeing stock can really take off.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 2: Morgan Stanley (MS)

Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is moving lower after the company reported earnings, as it struggles to hold above short-term support.
Despite beating on earnings and revenue estimates, Morgan Stanley is breaking below the 10-day, 21-day, 50-day and 10-week moving averages. It’s also trading down to last week’s low.
If it gives us a two-times weekly-down rotation, it could put sub-$75 in play down to the 21-week and 100-day moving averages.
On the upside, however, a move back above $80 alleviates some of the selling pressure. But over $82 puts the highs back in play. While I like the financial stocks, I’m cautious with Morgan Stanley until it can prove otherwise.
Top Stock Trades for Monday No. 3: Walmart (WMT)

Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is a name I’ll be watching closely next week.
Last week, we got a weekly-up rotation, as well as a monthly-up rotation, as Walmart cleared both the prior week’s high and the March high.
This week, shares nearly challenged the prior week’s high, but backed off those levels as it came into the 21-week moving and downtrend resistance (blue line). It’s also giving us an inside week, as this week’s range is entirely contained within the prior week.
So, what am I getting at here? Next week — and preferably, early next week — I’d love to see a rotation over $141.12 that builds momentum, as shares go two-times weekly up over the 21-week moving average.
That could pave the way for a move to $144.50 (gap fill), followed by $148, then $150-plus.

If that setup comes to fruition, some traders may consider using this week’s low as their stop-loss.
Top Trades for Monday No. 4: Alcoa (AA)

Alcoa (NYSE:AA) is trading nicely after earnings, hitting new 52-week highs in the process.
Now over $35, let’s see if shares can rally to the 200-month moving average, then the 261.8% extension near $40.
On the downside, though, keep it simple. Look for the 10-week moving average to continue acting as support. Below the 200-week moving average and $26 is on the table.
Top Trades for Monday No. 5: Coca-Cola (KO)

Click to Enlarge
Source: Chart courtesy of TrendSpider
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) will report earnings on Monday before the open. The stock has been very responsive between its 50% and 78.6% retracements.
From here, I would love to see a multi-week rotation higher, sending KO stock to the 78.6% retracement near $55 and preferably above this mark. A weekly close above $55 would open the door to $60, and potentially give Coca-Cola some much-needed momentum.
On the flip side, I would be a buyer on a pullback to the 200-week moving average and the 50% retracement, near $48.

3628.0,2022-04-20 00:00:00 UTC,Is a Beat in Store for Old Dominion (ODFL) in Q1 Earnings?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-a-beat-in-store-for-old-dominion-odfl-in-q1-earnings,,,"Old Dominion Freight Line ODFL is scheduled to report first-quarter 2022 results on Apr 27, before market open.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 2.2% in the past 60 days to $2.36.  The company has an impressive earnings history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.5%, on average.
Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.
Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
  Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. Quote
 Gradual recovery in the freight environment is anticipated to have aided Old Dominion’s first-quarter performance. This is expected to be reflected in less than truckload (LTL) revenue per hundredweight. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter LTL revenue per hundredweight suggests a rise of 16.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported. The anticipated improvement in LTL revenue per hundredweight is likely to be reflected in LTL services’ revenues, the company’s major revenue-generating segment. Per the consensus estimate, LTL tonnage per day surged 9.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.
Improvement in operating ratio (operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues) is likely to get reflected in the first-quarter bottom line (driven by higher revenues).  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the operating ratio is pegged at 75% for the quarter to be reported, indicating an improvement from 76% reported in first-quarter 2021. Lower the value of this key measure of efficiency, the better.
Higher operating expenses (due to a rise in costs pertaining to salaries, wages and benefits and an escalation in operating supplies and expenses) and high capital expenditures are likely to have hurt the company’s bottom line.
What Does the Zacks Model Say?
Our proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Old Dominion this time around. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen, which is exactly the case here. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Earnings ESP: Old Dominion has an Earnings ESP of +0.12% as the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.36. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Zacks Rank: Old Dominion carries a Zacks Rank #3, currently.
Highlights of Q4 Earnings
Old Dominion Freight Line’s earnings per share of $2.41 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 cents. The bottom line surged 49.7% year over year. Revenues of $1410.4 million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,372.5 million and increased 31.4% year over year.
Other Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the broader Transportation sector can also consider stocks like United Parcel Service UPS, Southwest Airlines Co. LUV and American Airlines Group AAL, as these stocks also possess the right combination of elements to beat estimates this reporting cycle.  
UPS has an Earnings ESP of +1.92% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked stock at present. UPS will release first-quarter 2022 results on Apr 26.
Strong package delivery demand is expected to have aided UPS’ first-quarter 2022 performance. Higher revenue per piece is likely to get reflected in U.S. Domestic Package revenues.
Southwest Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +28.09% and is currently a #3 Ranked player. LUV will release first-quarter 2022 results on Apr 28.
Southwest Airlines expects first-quarter 2022 operating revenues to decline 8-10% from the first quarter of 2019. The company expects to incur a loss in the period.
American Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +3.01% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked stock at present. AAL will release first-quarter 2022 results on Apr 21.
With air-travel demand steadily rebounding, AAL’s passenger revenues are expected to reflect a significant year-over-year increase. The anticipated increase in passenger revenues is likely to have driven the company’s top line in the first quarter.

156.0,2023-05-08 00:00:00 UTC,Twilio (TWLO) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/twilio-twlo-to-report-q1-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-offing,,,"Twilio Inc. TWLO is scheduled to report its first-quarter 2023 results on May 9.
Twilio anticipates revenues in the range of $995 million to $1.005 billion for the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $999.8 million, indicating an improvement of 14.2% from the year-ago quarter. Our estimate projects Twilio’s revenues to be $998.4 million.

The consensus mark for the non-GAAP earnings is pegged at 20 cents per share from the year-ago quarter breakeven. We expect Twilio to report earnings of 18 cents per share in the first quarter of 2023.
Twilio’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 130.1%.
Twilio Inc. Price and EPS Surprise
Twilio Inc. price-eps-surprise | Twilio Inc. Quote
Factors to Note
Twilio’s first-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from accelerated digital transformation projects across several industries while the world economy is rebounding. Organizations are continuing to reconfigure their setup for a hybrid operational environment.
The company’s revenues are likely to have witnessed contributions from its Zipwhip and Segment buyouts. Since the buyout in 2020, Segment has been aiding TWLO in enhancing its capabilities in the cloud-based communications platform space and gaining significant customers. The strong uptake of Segment, the growing adoption of Twilio Flex and an increasing clientele base are likely to have favored first-quarter performance.
Solutions like Journeys, Twilio Conversations, SendGrid Ads and SendGrid’s Email Validation application programming interface are likely to have contributed to first-quarter performance. The company’s efforts to fortify its global footprint are likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter's results.
In the last reported quarter, Twilio added around 10,000 new clients, taking the total active customer count to 290,000. In the first quarter, the company’s increasing scope among leading enterprises is likely to have acted as a key tailwind.
However, increased spending, investments in enhancing the product portfolio and expansion across newer markets are likely to have negatively impacted Twilio’s profitability.
What Our Model Says
Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Twilio this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.
Although TWLO carries a Zacks Rank #3, it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% at present. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Per our model, Agilent Technologies A, HP HPQ and Cisco Systems CSCO have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in upcoming releases.
Agilent Technologies has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The company is set to report its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 23. A’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

4697.0,2021-02-19 00:00:00 UTC,Omimex-owned fertilizer firm buys Brazil factory,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/omimex-owned-fertilizer-firm-buys-brazil-factory-2021-02-19,,,"By Ana Mano
SAO PAULO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Cibra, a fertilizer company majority owned by U.S.-based Omimex Resources Inc, has expanded its capacity in Brazil by buying a plant from Fertilizantes Heringer SA FHER3.SA for 55 million reais ($10.25 million), the companies said in statements on Friday.
Cibra said it bought the plant in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais with production capacity of 400,000 tonnes per year.
The deal will increase its Brazilian production capacity by 24%. The purchase is part of Cibra's 400 million reais expansion plan that aims to reach local production capacity of 2.5 million tonnes by 2025.
The purchase is subject to regulatory approvals.
Cibra, which is minority owned by Anglo American AAL.L, now owns 11 plants in Brazil -- the world's largest producer of foodstuffs like soybeans, coffee and orange juice.
In addition to the plant acquired in Minas Gerais, Cibra plans to build a new one this year and also buy at least one more production facility, Cibra said.
Cibra, one of the five largest fertilizer companies in Brazil, sold 1.7 million tonnes worth of products in the country last year, a 15% rise. It beat its own sales growth forecast of 6% for 2020, the company said.

3438.0,2022-07-01 00:00:00 UTC,Major U.S. airlines to allow gender-neutral option on ticket reservations,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/major-u.s.-airlines-to-allow-gender-neutral-option-on-ticket-reservations,,,"By David Shepardson
July 1 (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines have agreed to update computer systems by the end of 2024 to allow travelers to purchase tickets with an ""X"" gender marker, an airline trade group confirmed on Friday.
U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, in a letter to Airlines for America Chief Executive Nick Calio that was seen by Reuters, said member airlines committed to the change after he had engaged with the group. A spokeswoman for the airline group confirmed that Wyden's letter was accurate.
Airlines for America represents passenger carriers Delta Air Lines DAL.N, United Airlines UAL.O, American Airlines AAL.O, Southwest Airlines LUV.N, Alaska Airlines ALK.N, Hawaiian Airlines HA.O and JetBlue Airways JBLU.O.
In March, the Biden administration said Americans would be allowed to choose an ""X"" for gender on their passport applications and select their sex on Social Security cards.
""Nobody should have to misgender themselves in order to book a flight,"" Wyden wrote. ""And, by forcing travelers to book their ticket with inaccurate gender information, airlines also end up providing inaccurate information to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).""
Wyden's letter said ""member airlines will publish a page on their websites detailing the specific steps that nonbinary individuals can take to obtain tickets that reflect their gender, such as working with a customer service representative who can manually update the gender marker on their ticket.""
Wyden's letter noted that United and American Airlines ""have already changed their booking process to allow travelers to book tickets with an X gender marker, but not all U.S. airlines have followed their example.""
The State Department in June 2021 said U.S. citizens could select their gender on applications without having to submit medical documentation. In October, it issued the first American passport with an ""X"" gender marker.
The TSA in March said it would implement gender-neutral screening at its checkpoints with changes in imaging technology, reducing the number of pat-down screenings, removing gender identification from checkpoint screenings and updating TSA PreCheck to include an ""X"" gender marker on its application.

1293.0,2013-10-04 00:00:00 UTC,Trading Radar: Prepare for Third Quarter Earnings Next Week!,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trading-radar-prepare-third-quarter-earnings-next-week-2013-10-04,,,"The market's action this week was dominated by headlines about the government shutdown and the impending debt ceiling debate. That is not likely to change next week. Into the weekend, Republicans will likely take a softer approach to funding certain parts of the government. Thus far, much of the blame for the failure to pass a buddget has been placed on the GOP.
Retail sales are due out on Friday. During September, auto sales, gasoline prices, and same-store sales all declined significantly, which should lead to a drop in the monthly sales figures. The one upside? New iPhones ( AAPL ) was launched during the month and these sales could balance out some of the negativity. Producer prices are due out on Thursday and forecast to fall to a very low 0.6% year-over-year rate from a 1.4% gain in August.
The Treasury will auction 3-, 10-, and 30-year bonds next week. Treasury traders are on edge because nonfarm payrolls were not released in the prior week and it could upset the apple cart if they are released the same day as an auction in the coming week. This would create more volatility than normal as positions would need to be squared.
Once the government reopens, the payroll report should be able to be released within the following two days.
The minutes from the FOMC's September meeting will be released on Wednesday. Recent speeches by FOMC members have showed more disagreement among committee members than normal. The decision to not taper was largely influenced by the results of September's Beige Book. Reports from lenders through July and August showed that consumer lending had slowed precipitously, forcing the FOMC to take a more aggressive approach to calming interest rates.
Earnings season will finally get going on Tuesday. Is Alcoa's ( AA ) earnings report as significant as it once was now that it has been removed from the Dow Jones Industrial (INDEXDJX:.DJI)? Regardless, third quarter earnings will be kicked off by consumer-oriented Family Dollar ( FDO ) and Costco ( COST ). Finishing off the week are banks JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Wells Fargo (WFC). Fixed income trading slowed dramatically during the third quarter according to news reports from Jefferies, Deutsche Bank (DB), Citigroup (C), and UBS (UBS). This likely weighed negatively on JPMorgan in particular. In addition, Wells Fargo earnings were likely negatively impacted by a sharp slowdown in mortgage lending during the quarter. Hopefully the decline in activity during the quarter is balanced out by the large drop in mortgage rates during the last two weeks

132.0,2023-05-16 00:00:00 UTC,These 2 Computer and Technology Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/these-2-computer-and-technology-stocks-could-beat-earnings%3A-why-they-should-be-on-your-4,,,"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.
The earnings figure itself is key, of course, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb and vice versa.
Now that we know how important earnings and earnings surprises are, it's time to show investors how to take advantage of these events to boost their returns by utilizing the Zacks Earnings ESP filter.
The Zacks Earnings ESP, Explained
The Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate.
Now that we understand the basic idea, let's look at how the Expected Surprise Prediction works. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.
Bringing together a positive earnings ESP alongside a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better has helped stocks report a positive earnings surprise 70% of the time. Furthermore, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
Stocks with a ranking of #3 (Hold), or 60% of all stocks covered by the Zacks Rank, are expected to perform in-line with the broader market. Stocks with rankings of #2 (Buy) and #1 (Strong Buy), or the top 15% and top 5% of stocks, respectively, should outperform the market; Strong Buy stocks should outperform more than any other rank.
Should You Consider Splunk?
The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to quickly look at a qualifying stock. Splunk (SPLK) holds a #3 (Hold) at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at -$0.15 a share eight days away from its upcoming earnings release on May 24, 2023.
SPLK has an Earnings ESP figure of +12.16%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the -$0.15 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.17. Splunk is one of a large database of stocks with positive ESPs. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
SPLK is part of a big group of Computer and Technology stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Agilent Technologies (A) as well.
Slated to report earnings on May 23, 2023, Agilent Technologies holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $1.27 a share seven days from its next quarterly update.
For Agilent Technologies, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27 is +0.4%.
SPLK and A's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.

2594.0,2023-05-17 00:00:00 UTC,"US expects flights to jump on Memorial Day weekend, near pre-COVID levels",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/us-expects-flights-to-jump-on-memorial-day-weekend-near-pre-covid-levels,,,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON, May 17 (Reuters) - U.S. aviation regulators are forecasting nearly 313,000 flights over the seven-day Memorial Day holiday period, up 4.5% from 2022 and just below 2019 pre-pandemic levels.
The Federal Aviation Administration said the traditional seven-day kickoff to the busy U.S. summer travel season will surpass the 299,500 flights flown in the same period in 2022 but will not match the 321,000 flights in the same period in 2019.
On Wednesday, Delta Air Lines DAL.N estimated it will fly 2.8 million passengers for the upcoming Memorial Day holiday period, up 17% from 2022. On Tuesday, United Airlines UAL.O said it was planning for its busiest Memorial Day holiday in more than a decade, forecasting nearly 2.9 million passengers between May 25 and May 30.
American Airlines AAL.O said it will fly 26,637 flights over the Memorial Day period and carry 2.9 million passengers.
Last year, airlines had a rough Memorial Day weekend compounded by bad weather, cancelling more than 2,500 flights over a four-day period.
The FAA in March agreed to requests by Delta and United to temporarily return up to 10% of slots and flight timings this summer at congested New York area airports and Washington National, citing air traffic controller shortages.
Some airlines are operating larger planes to compensate for fewer flights, a move that the FAA said gives airlines ""the ability to reduce operations during the peak summer travel period, which are likely to be exacerbated by the effects of Air Traffic Controller staffing shortfalls.""
The FAA said its staffing at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control remain below targets. Last summer, there were 41,498 flights from New York airports where air traffic control staffing was a contributing factor in delays.
Earlier this month, the FAA said it activated 169 more direct routes along the U.S. East Coast ahead of the busy summer travel season, shaving off 40,000 miles and 6,000 minutes of travel time.

The FAA in March agreed to requests by Delta and United to temporarily return up to 10% of slots and flight timings this summer at congested New York area airports and Washington National, citing air traffic controller shortages.","American Airlines AAL.O said it will fly 26,637 flights over the Memorial Day period and carry 2.9 million passengers. By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, May 17 (Reuters) - U.S. aviation regulators are forecasting nearly 313,000 flights over the seven-day Memorial Day holiday period, up 4.5% from 2022 and just below 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Last summer, there were 41,498 flights from New York airports where air traffic control staffing was a contributing factor in delays."

1691.0,2012-01-10 00:00:00 UTC,I'm Buying 700 Additional Shares of This Bellwether Stock,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/im-buying-700-additional-shares-bellwether-stock-2012-01-10,,,"To make money in stocks, you need to focus on companies BEFORE everyone else does. And while many think of Alcoa ( AA ) , the second investment in my $100,000 real-money portfolio, as an out-of-favor cyclical play, I see a company that is on the cusp of rotating back into favor.
Of course, nobody likes to buy a stock in the face of imminent bad news. Falling aluminum prices throughout the last quarter clearly set the stage for a tough quarterly report . Last week, I predicted that ""the company will actually deliver a small loss instead of the consensus $0.08-a-share forecasted profit ."" (The consensus forecast stood at $0.03 a share in earnings for the fourth quarter when I wrote that, but had fallen to a $0.02 a share loss forecast by the close of trading on Monday, Jan. 9.) [Don't miss a single move in my real-money portfolio. Go here to sign up for free updates .]
Why buy a stock that is likely to miss forecasts? Because as I also wrote last week, ""the market anticipates a sorry outcome, and there's a solid chance investors will start to focus on management's expected long-term bullish outlook for supply, demand and pricing.""
How did things turn out? Well, Alcoa lost just $0.03.
How did shares react? As of this writing, they are actually modestly higher in after-hours trading . That's because CEO Klaus Kleinfeld predicted that global aluminum demand would rise 7% in 2012, compared with 2011 levels. His bullishness largely stems from production plans at Boeing ( BA ) and Airbus, along with auto makers that are using an increasing amount of aluminum in vehicles to save weight. Alcoa predicts demand will exceed supply in 2012, and if that happens, then aluminum prices could well finish the year closer to $1.10 or even $1.20 a pound. Prices are currently near $0.93. (Alcoa makes money when this figure moves above $1.)
Make no mistake, Alcoa had a tough year in 2011. Slumping aluminum prices offset so many of the savings that the company has achieved the last few years. Still, Alcoa managed to generate more than $1 billion in operating cash flow (and more than $600 million in free cash flow ) in that lousy fourth quarter. Cash rose from $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2011 to $1.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. As I wrote last week: ""Alcoa is now positioned to post respectable free cash flow in tough times, and poised to post stunningly high levels of cash flow when the global economy perks up.""
Also of note, aluminum inventories shrank from $3.2 billion in the third quarter to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter. That underscores the company's notion that a glut of aluminum is being worked off, which should have a positive future impact on pricing and profits.
In the next few days, analysts will issue updated profit forecasts for 2012.
Ignore them.
These forecasts are pegged off very depressed aluminum prices. If I read this correctly, demand will slowly rebound as China continues to swing deeper into a "" net importer "" position, spot prices for aluminum will rise, and so will analysts' estimates. Their view at the start of 2012 has little to do with their view later in 2012.
Action to Take --> On Thursday, Jan.11, I will be adding to my current 300-share position with another 700 shares, bring my total position to 1,000 shares.

1186.0,2014-03-18 00:00:00 UTC,Alcoa Expands Wheel Plant in Hungary - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alcoa-expands-wheel-plant-in-hungary-analyst-blog-2014-03-18,,,"Aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. ( AA ) announced that it is investing $13 million in Szekesfehervar, Hungary, to expand its plant to meet increasing European demand for truck wheels, which are more durable and lightweight than earlier models with minimum maintenance.
With the expansion of the plant, Alcoa will be able to produce twice as many Dura-Bright EVO surface-treated wheels in Europe by early 2015. The Dura-Bright EVO has all the benefits which were present in its predecessor, the Dura-Bright wheel with XBR technology.
The Dura-Bright EVO surface-treated wheel is 10 times more resistant to corrosion primarily caused by road salts and weather elements and is also about three times more resistant to chemicals, including hydrofluoric acid, found in the toughest truck cleaning agents. Dura-bright treated wheel helps in retaining the shine even after use for many years without the need for polishing.
Alcoa commenced the construction on the product line expansion in Jan 2014 and expects it to complete in early 2015. The expansion will create 35 new permanent jobs and around 215 temporary jobs during construction. In addition to Alcoa's $13 million investment, the Hungarian government will also contribute $4.4 million toward the construction through its Regional Operative Program.
The expansion will increase Alcoa's presence in Hungary and add to its portfolio which produces value added products for the automotive and aerospace industries.
Alcoa, a prominent player in the mining industry along with Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd. ( ACH ), Atlatsa Resources Corp. ( ATL ) and BHP Billiton Ltd. ( BHP ), is a world leader in production and management of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina.
Alcoa currently retains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2238.0,2023-09-27 00:00:00 UTC,3 Household Names With RSIs That Scream Oversold,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-household-names-with-rsis-that-scream-oversold,,,"With the benchmark S&P 500 index continuing to trade down from its summer highs, there are plenty of stocks feeling the worst for wear. It’s easy for a rally to begin, or indeed for an existing one to be pushed higher, when investors are buying, but the exact opposite is true when they’re selling. 
With the S&P 500 itself down more than 5% since the start of the month, it won’t be a surprise to learn that some stocks that were already underperforming have been pushed down even further. For those of our readers who love a bargain, that can open up great opportunities. To find these, a stock’s relative strength index (RSI) can be one of the easiest and clearest signals to use. At the risk of over-simplifying it, imagine the RSI as a tool to help you decide if a stock is overbought, and due a pullback or oversold, and due a bounce back.
It works on a scale of 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests overbought conditions, and below 30 suggests oversold conditions. With that in mind, here are three well-known stocks, all household names, with RSIs well below 30. 
American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL)
Shares of the airline major have been sliding since July, which is where their post-pandemic rally ran out of steam. Higher fuel costs, the threat of industrial action, and dwindling revenue growth have all combined to send shares down more than 30% in that timeframe. It will be particularly painful for long-term investors who would have been buoyed by the past year's strong traffic numbers but are now looking at their shares trading down towards their Covid lows. 
However, the selloff has been steep enough to also send American Airlines RSI down towards lows. It’s currently just around 20, indicating extremely oversold conditions. It’s only come down here a handful of times in the past few years. The most recent was in March 2020, and then it was basically just once a year, stretching back to 2016. While not all of these timestamps signaled the complete reversal of a trend, they did all signal an imminent rally was about to take place, with trough-to-peak gains of between 30-150% following. 
There are fundamental headwinds that investors will have to be mindful of with American Airlines, and there are better stocks out there to be buying with a long-term mindset. But from a technical perspective, the signs are pointing towards an aggressive bounce back in the short term, at least. 
Shake Shack Inc (NYSE: SHAK)
The shares of ShackBurger HQ have been under pressure since July as well, though for different reasons than American Airlines. It had an earnings report that came in soft against expectations, and its shares are down almost 30% in the past two months. 
But the trading activity has been so one way, that is, down, Shake Shack’s RSI is figuratively speaking on the floor. Its current reading of 22 has only been hit on three other occasions since the stock IPO’d in 2016. Average trough-to-peak gains in the stock following each of these occasions was 150%. 
In addition to having the technical argument on your side, the team at Northcoast Research has cottoned on to the longer-term buying opportunity opening up as well. They see recent headwinds continuing to dissipate through the rest of the year and had no problem giving shares a price target of $85. That’s pointing to an upside of at least 50% from where they were trading on Tuesday morning. 
Boeing Co (NYSE: BA)
Boeing shares managed to rally into August before starting their current slide. They’d been adding gains all year, to be fair, with August’s peak just the latest milestone in a rally that dates back eighteen months. But a 20% slide since then has them back where they started the year, with a long string of red days along the way. 
The good news is, though, that their current RSI reading of 24 was last seen in May 2022, right before the stock started its multi-month run to last month’s high. Along the way, they tacked on over 100% in value. If this is to be the spot where the bears run out of steam, and the bulls take control once again, it would have a nice ring to it. 
The team at Wells Fargo thinks we could be looking at the low soon. Last week, they increased their Boeing allocation in the company’s Signature Picks list, indicating the time could be ripe for bargain hunters to also start backing up the truck.

The good news is, though, that their current RSI reading of 24 was last seen in May 2022, right before the stock started its multi-month run to last month’s high.","American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) Shares of the airline major have been sliding since July, which is where their post-pandemic rally ran out of steam. There are fundamental headwinds that investors will have to be mindful of with American Airlines, and there are better stocks out there to be buying with a long-term mindset.

This is evident from its latest InfinityLab Gel Permeation Chromatography/Size Exclusion Chromatography (GPC/SEC) solutions, which the company is gearing up to showcase at the HPLC 2023 conference.

With the new solutions, which are designed for advanced material characterization, the company strengthened its Agilent InfinityLab GPC/SEC portfolio. Moreover, the portfolio now includes the benefits of the Polymer Standard Service acquisition.

Notably, the new additions include the likes GPC/SEC column thermostat, the GPC/SEC-Ready Kit, a multi-angle light scattering detector and the powerful WinGPC Software.

The combined portfolio of InfinityLab GPC/SEC and Polymer Standard Service will help Agilent cater well to the needs of scientists in macromolecular analysis.

Also, it will aid its momentum across the chemical, food, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries.

LSAG Segment in Focus
The latest move bodes well for the company’s growing efforts toward bolstering its Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group (LSAG) segment, which contributes the most to total revenues.

Apart from the expansion of the Agilent InfinityLab GPC/SEC portfolio, the company recently launched the 6495 Triple Quadrupole LC/MS (LC/TQ) System and the Revident Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/MS (LC/QTOF) System.

Notably, 6495 LC/TQ is designed to take care of the critical transition between the discovery phase of research and the translational phase to generate meaningful scientific insights on the back of its intelligence features.

Meanwhile, Revident LC/Q-TOF features instrument intelligence for maximized operation time and productivity and a novel detection system that boosts spectral purity.
To Conclude
The abovementioned endeavors are expected to continue aiding the performance of the LSAG segment.

In second-quarter fiscal 2023, the underlined segment generated $968 million in revenues, which accounted for 56% of the total revenues. The figure was up 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a core basis from the prior-year fiscal quarter’s levels.

We believe the company’s strong focus on bolstering the LSAG segment will benefit its overall performance.

For fiscal 2023, Agilent expects revenues between $6.93 billion and $7.03 billion, implying growth of 1.2-2.7% on a reported basis and 3-4.5% on a core basis from the respective fiscal 2022 figures. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Agilent's fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $6.99 billion, indicating growth of 2% from 2022.

However, mounting expenses do not bode well for the company’s profitability. Further, macroeconomic headwinds and uncertainties in the demand environment remain concerns.

Coming to price performance, Agilent has lost 20% in the year-to-date period against the industry’s growth of 4.5%.
Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider
Currently, Agilent Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Palo Alto Networks PANW, NVIDIA NVDA and AMETEK AME. While Palo Alto Networks and NVIDIA sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each, AME carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Palo Alto Networks shares have gained 65% in the year-to-date period. The long-term earnings growth rate for PANW is currently projected at 31.5%.

VSH has rolled out a new series of automotive-grade thick film chip resistors - Vishay Techno CDMA. This is a testament to its strong focus toward strengthening resistors offerings.

Notably, the new series comprises two resistors integrated into a single package with a 5 mm creepage distance. Further, these devices feature high working voltages up to 1415 V and come in a compact 2512 case size.

The underlined series comes with a wide resistance range from 500 kΩ to 50 MΩ. Further, it offers maximum standard resistance ratio to 600:1, tolerances down to ± 0.5% and TCR tracking as low as ± 10 ppm/°C.

The latest move of the company is likely to drive momentum across automotive and industrial applications, as the new resistors are capable of lowering component counts and placement costs while reducing PCB sizes.

More precisely, the underlined resistors are ideal for voltage monitoring and overvoltage protection in high-power DC/DC converters and inverters, on-board chargers and battery management systems in electric vehicles and industrial equipment.

Resistor Market Holds Promise
The chip resistor market is riding on the growing proliferation of consumer electronic devices globally. Further, increasing demand for smartphones and the growing proliferation of Internet of Things and cloud computing are spiking the demand for chip resistors.

Additionally, solid adoption of AI and rapid deployment of 5G are accelerating the need for these resistors further.

Additionally, the emergence of hybrid electric vehicles and rising adoption remain key catalysts in the chip resistor market. We believe the latest launch makes Vishay well poised to capitalize on these opportunities.

According to a report from Research Dive, theglobal marketfor chip resistors is expected to reach $3.3 billion by 2028, witnessing a CAGR of 6.9% between 2021 and 2028.
Expanding Product Portfolio
The latest move is in sync with the company’s growing efforts toward expanding its overall product portfolio.

Apart from the latest introduction, Vishay recently upgraded its TSOP2xxx, TSOP4xxx, TSOP57xxx, TSOP6xxx and TSOP77xxx series of Infrared Receiver (IR) modules with the new Cyllene 2 IC.

Vishay unveiled three new series of automotive-grade surface-mount standard rectifiers, 2 A SE20Nx, 3 A SE30Nx and 4 A SE40Nx. Further, these devices offer improved reverse recovery energy and fast recovery time and can also be utilized as high-frequency rectifiers for bootstrap driver functionality.

Additionally, it rolled out two new 30 V symmetric dual n-channel power MOSFETs, SiZF5300DT and SiZF5302DT, which can be used in place of two discrete devices in the PowerPAK 1212 package.

Further, the company introduced three new series of 130 A to 300 A three-phase bridge power modules in the ultra-compact MTC package that delivers reliable operation for heavy-duty industrial applications.

We believe that the above-mentioned endeavors will continue to shape the company’s growth trajectory and sustain momentum in various end markets.

However, Vishay is currently suffering from coronavirus-led supply-chain constraints, consumer market softness and impacts of geo-political tensions.

(NYSE:A) Insiders Been Selling Their Stock?",A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/have-agilent-technologies-inc.-nyse%3Aa-insiders-been-selling-their-stock,,,"We'd be surprised if Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) shareholders haven't noticed that the Senior VP & President of Agilent Cross Lab Group, Padraig McDonnell, recently sold US$337k worth of stock at US$134 per share. That sale was 14% of their holding, so it does make us raise an eyebrow.
Agilent Technologies Insider Transactions Over The Last Year
Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the CEO, President & Director, Michael McMullen, for US$18m worth of shares, at about US$149 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$138. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.
In the last year Agilent Technologies insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!

Does Agilent Technologies Boast High Insider Ownership?
Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Agilent Technologies insiders own about US$114m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.
So What Do The Agilent Technologies Insider Transactions Indicate?
An insider sold Agilent Technologies shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Agilent Technologies is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Agilent Technologies. You'd be interested to know, that we found 1 warning sign for Agilent Technologies and we suggest you have a look.

1703.0,2012-01-09 00:00:00 UTC,A Slow Week to Bring Back Euro Concerns? - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/slow-week-bring-back-euro-concerns-analyst-blog-2012-01-09,,,"Stocks were a lot less enthusiastic to last week's labor market reports than would otherwise have been expected, likely reflecting lingering concerns about Europe. The going is expected to be even tougher this week as theeconomic calendaris relatively thin and the fourth quarter reporting season just gets underway. This means that Europe will remain in the spotlight, with headlines from the region moving the market.
The only notable economic report this week is the December Retail Sales reading on Thursday. Other than that, we will have International Trade data on Friday and the Jobless Claims numbers on Thursday. The fourth quarter reporting season gets underway with Alcoa's ( AA ) results after the close today. But the only other notable earnings report the rest of this week is from J.P. Morgan ( JPM ) on Friday.
Earnings expectations remain quite low at this stage, reflecting the maturity of the earnings cycle, developments in Europe and the slowdown in China and other emerging markets. With aggregate margins reaching prior cyclical peak levels and top-line gains getting difficult to come by given the tougher nominal global growth backdrop, the growth numbers for the fourth quarter are expected to be much lower than what we have been seeing thus far in this earnings cycle.
In corporate news, Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY ) is acquiring Inhibitex ( INHX ), the developer of hepatitis-C, for $2.5 billion in cash. The all-cash offer works out to a very generous 163% premium to Inhibitex's Friday closing price. Shares of Idenix Pharmaceuticals ( IDIX ) are also expected to be in the spotlight after the company announced positive results from its hepatitis C clinical trial.

3918.0,2021-12-29 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines Group Reaches Analyst Target Price,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-group-reaches-analyst-target-price,,,"In recent trading, shares of American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $18.29, changing hands for $18.54/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher — if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.
There are 14 different analyst targets within the Zacks coverage universe contributing to that average for American Airlines Group Inc, but the average is just that — a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $5.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $29.00. The standard deviation is $7.097.
But the whole reason to look at the average AAL price target in the first place is to tap into a ""wisdom of crowds"" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with AAL crossing above that average target price of $18.29/share, investors in AAL have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $18.29 just one stop on the way to an even higher target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover American Airlines Group Inc:

Delta Air Lines posted better-than-expected results thanks to a continued recovery in travel demand, reporting EPS of $1.48, which exceeded our consensus estimate by more than 14.7%.
In addition, Delta generated roughly $13.4 billion in revenue throughout the period, more than enough to exceed the Zacks Consensus Sales estimate of $13 billion and reflecting a sizable 41% Y/Y increase. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.

Demand remained hot throughout the quarter, resulting in a 7% uptick in Domestic total passenger revenue compared to the December 2019 quarter. It’s worth noting that many airliners base their growth comps on pre-pandemic levels.
Further, operating cash flow totaled $1.2 billion, and the company made $285 million in payments on debt and finance lease obligations throughout the period.
Ed Bastian, CEO, on the results, “As we move into 2023, the industry backdrop for air travel remains favorable and Delta is well positioned to deliver significant earnings and free cash flow growth.  We expect to grow 2023 revenue by 15 to 20 percent and improve unit costs year-over-year, supporting a full-year outlook for earnings of $5 to $6 per share and keeping us on track to achieve more than $7 of earnings per share in 2024.”
Delta Air Lines shares are up nearly 20% YTD.

Analysts have been bullish for AAL’s quarter, with estimates suggesting a sizable recovery within earnings and revenue.
Further, the company has consistently beat expectations as of late, and the company’s forward price-to-sales-ratio remains below the five-year median.
Heading into the release, American Airlines is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an Earnings ESP Score of 9.8%.
Zacks Names ""Single Best Pick to Double""
From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.
It’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.
This company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.

3872.0,2022-01-14 00:00:00 UTC,Will Cost Woes Dampen American Airlines' (AAL) Q4 Earnings?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/will-cost-woes-dampen-american-airlines-aal-q4-earnings,,,"American Airlines Group AAL is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2021 results on Jan 20, before market open.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter loss has widened by 3.5% in the past 60 days. Given this, let’s take a look at the factors that are expected to have influenced the company’s fourth-quarter performance:

With improved air-travel demand, American Airlines’ passenger revenues are expected to reflect sequential increase in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter passenger revenues indicates a 1.1% rise from the third-quarter reported number. Robust Thanksgiving holiday demand is expected to have boosted the carrier’s passenger revenues.

However, mass-scale flight cancellations between late October and early November, as well as during the Christmas travel period through the end of the year owing to staffing shortages and inclement weather conditions, pushed up American Airlines’ costs. The airline expects cost per available seat mile (“CASM”) to increase 13-14% in the fourth quarter from the 2019 level. Apart from reduced capacity, a holiday operational incentive program in the fourth quarter and a write down of excess spare-parts inventory pushed up the company’s unit costs. The higher expenses are likely to have hurt AAL’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.

Rising fuel costs are also expected to have dented American Airlines’ bottom line in the fourth quarter. American Airlines estimates average fuel price per gallon to be $2.36 for the fourth quarter, indicating a rise of 14% from the third quarter’s reported figure. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $2.42.

Despite improving, air-travel demand continues to be below the pre-pandemic levels. As a result, American Airlines expects total revenues to decline approximately 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021 from the comparable period in 2019.

Earnings Whispers
The proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American Airlines this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. However, this is not the case here, as elaborated below. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Earnings ESP: American Airlines has an earnings ESP of -0.34% as the Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.79, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is poised at a loss of $1.78. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Highlights of Q3 Earnings
American Airlines incurred an adjusted loss of 99 cents per share in the third quarter of 2021, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.04. This was the seventh consecutive quarterly loss incurred by the company as coronavirus continues to weigh on air-travel demand. Operating revenues of $8,969 million skyrocketed 182.67% year over year and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,926.6 million. The upside was due to significant increase in passenger revenues, thanks to improved air-travel demand.
Stocks to Consider
Investors interested in the broader Transportation sector may consider C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW, Southwest Airlines LUV and Landstar System LSTR, as these stocks possess the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this reporting cycle.

C.H. Robinson currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.79% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company will report fourth-quarter 2021 results on Feb 2.

Favorable pricing and higher volumes, owing to improved freight market conditions, are expected to have aided C.H. Robinson’s fourth-quarter performance.

Southwest Airlines has an Earnings ESP of +227.38% and is currently a Zacks #3 Ranked player. The company will release fourth-quarter 2021 results on Jan 27.

Southwest Airlines expects to be profitable in the fourth quarter of 2021 owing to a strong Thanksgiving holiday travel period, higher fares and benefits from the co-brand credit card agreement with Chase.

Landstar System has an Earnings ESP of +3.19% and is Zacks #3 Ranked, presently. The company will release fourth-quarter 2021 results on Jan 26.

Landstar’s fourth-quarter performance is expected to have benefited from higher truck rates and strong freight demand.

2460.0,2023-07-13 00:00:00 UTC,CSX Gears Up to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Offing?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/csx-gears-up-to-report-q2-earnings%3A-whats-in-the-offing,,,"CSX Corporation CSX is scheduled to report second-quarter 2023 results on Jul 20, after market close.
The stock has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 7.8%. The consensus estimate for second-quarter earnings has declined 2% to 49 cents per share over the past 60 days.
Given this backdrop, let’s examine the factors that are likely to have influenced CSX’s performance in the quarter to be reported.
We expect coal revenues to have been impressive primarily due to high export-coal prices. We estimate coal revenues to increase 18.1% during second-quarter 2023 from second-quarter 2022 actuals.
CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
  CSX Corporation price-eps-surprise | CSX Corporation Quote
However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues indicates a 2.2% decrease year over year. Our model estimates Intermodal and Merchandise revenues to decline 24% and 2.7%, respectively, from second-quarter 2022 actuals.
Moreover, supply-chain disruptions including labor and equipment shortages are expected to have hurt CSX’s second-quarter performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings suggests a fall of 2% year over year.
What Our Model Says
Our proven model does not conclusively predict earnings beat for CSX this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
CSX has an Earnings ESP of -0.68% and a Zacks Rank #3.
Q1 Highlights
Quarterly earnings of 48 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents and improved 23.1% year over year. Total revenues of $3,706 million outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,599.1 million.

1876.0,2010-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,"Monday Winners: Century Aluminum, United Micro and Perfect World",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/monday-winners-century-aluminum-united-micro-and-perfect-world-2010-06-21,,,"Among the biggest winners in Monday's early trading are Century Aluminum (Nasdaq: CENX ) , United Micro (NYSE: UMC ) and Perfect World (Nasdaq: PWRD ) .
Aluminum Stocks love a Stronger Yuan
A wide range of aluminum and steel stocks are rallying this morning, led by a +11% gain for Century Aluminum (Nasdaq: CENX ) . Many of these firms, such as Alcoa (NYSE: AA ) , POSCO (NYSE: PKX ) or U.S. Steel (NYSE: X ) have struggled to raise prices while Chinese rivals flooded the market with lower cost products. If China indeed is set to finally strengthen its currency , other Asian countries may follow suit. And that would enable these aluminum and steel producers to raise prices or take market share .
Action to Take --> A stronger Yuan helps, but a balanced and stable growing global economy is the real panacea for this group, as that would allow for improved pricing and profits. It's too soon to know if the currency moves will aid the results of these firms, so it's not clear if there is stronger near-term upside for these rallying names.
-------------------------------------
A Foundry bags New Business
Shares of United Micro (NYSE: UMC ) are up more than +6% this morning after the Taiwan-based company announced a joint venture to co-develop a low-power chip with Japan's Elpida. By pooling these resources, these firms can trim R&D costs while staying on the cutting edge. And UMC, the world's second-largest maker of chips, also benefits by securing production rights to the new chip they plan to co-develop. Chip foundries can be hugely profitable when kept busy.
Just a week ago, UMC announced that second-quarter sales would be strong, and added that its foundries should be quite busy for the rest of the year as well. That should enable the company to post a sharp +300% gain in profits this year.
Action to Take --> Analysts expect profits to rise another +20% in 2011 to around $0.25 a share. Yet those forecasts now look too conservative in light of recent announcements. (Investors should note that UMC has earned more than $0.20 a share only once in any fiscal year during the past decade). The company should post record profits next year, but at around 10 to 11 times likely upward-revised forecasts, shares may have limited potential appreciation from here - at least until we know more about the company's chip development plans with Elpida. This is a name that is suitable for further research, but know that chip foundries rarely garner high price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) multiples.
-------------------------------------
Perfect World: A Possible Yuan Play
Chinese video gaming stocks have taken it on the chin this year, but investors may start to warm up to the sector once again. A stronger Yuan would lead to higher results in terms of dollars, so look for analysts to boost their profit forecasts if and when China actually starts to strengthen its currency.
Shares of Perfect World (Nasdaq: PWRD ) are up +8.5% on that sentiment. Right now, analysts think Perfect World can earn close to $4 a share in 2011. But a stronger Yuan may lift that view closer to $4.25 - all other things being equal. Shares trade at just six times that figure.
Action to Take --> Analysts will likely hold off boosting profit forecasts until it becomes clear that China will let its currency rise. Once that process is underway, expect a solid boost in estimates for all China-based consumers that sell into the Chinese domestic market. Perfect World is just one of many stocks that hold the dual support of low P/Es and rising profits.

621.0,2022-10-27 00:00:00 UTC,COLUMN-Metal markets brace for a downturn of a different kind: Andy Home,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/column-metal-markets-brace-for-a-downturn-of-a-different-kind%3A-andy-home-0,,,"By Andy Home
LONDON Oct 27 (Reuters) - The spectre of recession has hung heavy over this year's London Metal Exchange (LME) Week festivities.
The analyst consensus is that Europe's manufacturing sector is already contracting and the United States may well follow.
Demand forecasts have been slashed. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) now expects global zinc usage to contract by 1.9% this year. At its April meeting it was expecting 1.6% growth.
The International Nickel Study Group has cut its global demand forecast from 8.6% in May to 4.2%, reflecting a slide in stainless steel production.
Large amounts of aluminium are already turning up in LME warehouses as the supply chain destocks.
The LME Index .LMEX, a basket of core base metals, has gone from boom to bust in double-quick time, collapsing by 29% from its all-time highs in March.
But this downturn comes with three unusual characteristics which have combined to create a heady cocktail of uncertainty.
RUSSIAN METAL - TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT?
The status of Russian metal has been a key talking-point at the many seminars and parties this week in London.
Should the LME suspend deliveries of Russian aluminium, copper and nickel or should it maintain its policy of not preempting official sanctions?
Battle-lines are drawn.
German copper producer AurubisNAFG.DE has joined U.S. aluminium producer AlcoaAA.N in publicly calling for an LME ban on Russian metal. Norway's Hydro NHY.OL wants government sanctions.
European aluminium consumers group FACE wants the European Commission to intervene to prevent any ban, saying it would risk ""the destruction of the independent downstream European aluminium industry"".
The deadline for responses to the LME's discussion paper is Friday.
There is a lot of metal supply at stake here. Rusal produces almost four million tonnes of aluminium each year.
Nornickel accounts for around 7% of global nickel supply and, critically for the LME, is a major supplier of the Class I metal deliverable against the exchange's contract.
Russia produced 920,000 tonnes of refined copper last year, about 3.5% of the world's total, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
An LME ban on deliveries of Russian metal would clearly have significant ramifications for both LME and physical market pricing. More government sanctions would make an even harder impact.
SMELTER PROBLEMS, LOW STOCKS
The second oddity is that the downturn in pricing is coming at a time when supply in many metals is still very stressed.
Europe has already lost over a million tonnes of aluminium smelting capacity due to high energy prices and it's likely to lose more as power price hedges expire.
The impact on the aluminium price has been cushioned by the simultaneous downturn in spot demand and an aggressive ramp-up of production in China over the first half of the year.
However, China's aluminium smelters are facing constraints too, particularly those in the drought-hit hydro province of Yunnan, an emerging hub of ""green"" metal production.
The smelter bottleneck is most acute in zinc, reflecting both European power-related curtailments and a string of problems at other smelters around the world. Canada's CEZ has just joined the list, announcing it will close by the end of the month for preemptive cell maintenance. It doesn't yet know when it will be back.
The ILZSG is forecasting another year of supply deficit for both zinc and lead next year as smelter availability reduces the flow of mined concentrate.
The outlook is for continued high physical premiums, particularly in Europe and North America, and no rebuild in depleted exchange stocks.
Copper is least impacted by the energy crisis and there is broad analyst consensus around The International Copper Study Group's (ICSG) forecast for the global refined market to move from supply deficit to a 155,000-tonne surplus next year.
However, the modest scale of that surplus is likely to keep supply tight and, like zinc and lead, will do nothing to replenish depleted visible stocks.
The conundrum of low price and low inventory seems set to continue for a while and it will become more acute if the LME were to restrict the delivery of Russian metal.
GREEN TRANSITION
While its sister organisations downgraded their demand forecasts for lead, nickel and zinc, the ICSG has actually lifted its demand growth estimate for this year from 1.9% to 2.2%.
China's strong imports of refined copper this year have boosted the ICSG's calculation of apparent usage to 2.5%. Imports are likely to accelerate further given the drawdown in bonded warehouse stocks and the resulting super-high import premium.
The country's hunger for copper seems anomalous given the well-flagged problems in the property sector, a major component of Chinese copper demand.
However, it seems that copper usage, in China at least, is now finding an extra driver in the form of government investment in green transition technology.
The much-hyped green booster may finally be starting to arrive and it raises the interesting question of whether Doctor Copper will retain his price relationship with the broader economic cycle or will start to move more in tune with the decarbonisation cycle.
This is already happening in nickel. Although usage in electric vehicle batteries is still small relative to that of the stainless steel sector, it's growing faster and is playing an ever more important role in theglobal marketstructure.
The high energy prices that are roiling both metal producers and consumers will accelerate the green transition as Europe looks to reduce its dependency on Russian fossil fuels.
That means even more government funding for renewable generation capacity and for electric vehicles subsidies, bringing forward both the energy transition timetable and the draw on the metals needed to achieve it.
CLOUDY OUTLOOK
The world is going to need a lot more metal if it is to meet its carbon reduction targets. Unfortunately current prices are too low to incentivise the necessary investment in new mine and smelter capacity.
It's a major conundrum which can be added to the puzzling mix of bearish outright pricing, existing supply disruption, potential Russian supply disruption and, in several cases, critically low exchange inventory.
Confused? Don't worry. So was just about everyone else in London this week.

1654.0,2012-03-30 00:00:00 UTC,"Stock Market News for March 30, 2012 - Market News",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-news-for-march-30-2012-market-news-2012-03-30,,,"Except for the Dow, which staged a comeback in the final hours, the benchmarks closed in the red yesterday as economic data that included a lower-than expected drop in initial claims dampened investor sentiment. Markets have been witnessing selling pressure as the quarter nears its end, but benchmarks have put in decent performances starting this year as also this month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) edged up 0.2% and closed the day at 13,145.82. The Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) dropped 0.2% and finished yesterday's trading session at 1,403.28. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was down to 3,095.36, lower by 0.3%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was nearly flat yesterday as it gained a negligible 0.01 to close at 15.48. Consolidated volumes on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the Amex were 6.80 billion shares, marginally short of the daily average volume of 6.83 billion. Decliners held an edge over the advancing stocks on the NYSE, as they outnumbered the gainers by a ratio of 3:2.
The day's action largely depended on economic data, which unfortunately for the markets failed to please. The U.S. Department of Labor reported a 5,000 decline in seasonally adjusted initial claims for the week ending March 24, to 359,000, compared with previous week's revised figure of 364,000. Following this drop, initial claims were at the lowest point since April 2008. However, the less-than-expected drop in initial claims acted as a drag on the markets. Consensus estimates had projected the figure to come in at 349, 000.
Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Commerce came out with the third estimate of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ), or the second revision of the original figure. The Bureau of Economic Analysis in its third estimate said that Real GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.0% in the final quarter of 2011. The 3.0% growth rate was in line with the second estimate, but the third estimate consists of 'more complete source data' than the latter. According to the report, private inventory investment, personal consumption expenditures ( PCE ), non-residential fixed investment, exports, and residential fixed investment positively impacted the GDP, whereas federal government spending and state and local government spending were the deterrents. The 3.0% growth in GDP was lower than consensus estimates of 3.1%, and failed to create any optimism.
The report also noted: ""Real personal consumption expenditures increased 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an increase of 1.7 percent in the third. Durable goods increased 16.1 percent, compared with an increase of 5.7 percent. Nondurable goods increased 0.8 percent, in contrast to a decrease of 0.5 percent. Services increased 0.4 percent, compared with an increase of 1.9 percent"".
Meanwhile, a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City revealed that higher gasoline prices had taken a toll on manufacturing activity in the region. The Kansas City Fed's manufacturing composite index, which is the average of the indexes covering production, new orders, employment, delivery times and raw-materials inventories slowed to 9 in March from 13 in the prior month.
While these reports dampened investment sentiment, the blue-chip index managed to rebound only in the late hours as buyers moved to take advantage of the selling pressure. Alcoa, Inc. (NYSE: AA ) led the gains among the 30 Dow components, jumping 2.0%, followed by stocks including Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT ), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX ), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ), The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO ), McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD ) and United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX ), which gained 1.7%, 0.9%, 1.3%, 1.6%, 0.6% and 1.0%, respectively.

3543.0,2022-05-12 00:00:00 UTC,EXCLUSIVE-Anglo American to return to Zambia with Arc Minerals copper deal,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/exclusive-anglo-american-to-return-to-zambia-with-arc-minerals-copper-deal,,,"By Helen Reid
CAPE TOWN, May 12 (Reuters) - Anglo American AAL.L has agreed a deal to take majority control of Arc Minerals' Zambia copper-cobalt exploration licences, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said, which is Anglo's first investment in Zambia in 20 years.
The joint venture deal would give Anglo a 70% interest in London-listed exploration firm Arc Minerals' ARCMA.L licenses in Zambia's copper-rich North-Western province, covering an area which Anglo previously explored in the late 1990s.
Major mining firms are searching for new sources of the battery metals copper and cobalt, especially since the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia sent metal prices soaring.
Anglo American will pay $3.5 million into the joint venture upon signing, and can retain its stake in the venture by spending $74 million on exploration within seven years of signing and making cash payments of $11 million into the JV, according to a draft of the deal terms reviewed by Reuters.
Anglo American declined to comment on the deal when contacted by Reuters.
An Arc Minerals spokesperson also declined to comment, saying Arc does not to comment on speculation.
Arc Minerals previously had an exclusivity agreement with Anglo from July 2020 to July 2021, and when that lapsed Arc Minerals said it would start talks with other major miners that had approached it.
Zambia, Africa's second-largest copper producer, has become a more attractive investment proposition for mining companies since the election last August of business-friendly President Hakainde Hichilema and a subsequent mining tax reform.
The country aims to more than triple its annual copper output within the next decade to 3 million tonnes a year.

506.0,2023-04-27 00:00:00 UTC,Japan buyers agree to pay Q2 aluminium premiums of $125-$130/T -sources,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/japan-buyers-agree-to-pay-q2-aluminium-premiums-of-%24125-%24130-t-sources,,,"By Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO, April 27 (Reuters) - The premiums for aluminium shipments to Japanese buyers for April to June were set at $125-$130 a tonne, up 45-53% from the previous quarter, to reflect higher spot premiums elsewhere in Asia, four people directly involved in pricing talks said.
The figures compare with $85-$86 per tonne paid in the January-March quarter and mark the first quarterly increase in six quarters. The higher prices are in line with or lower than the initial offers of $125-$145 per tonne made by producers.
Japan is Asia's biggest importer of the light metal and the premiums PREM-ALUM-JP for primary metal shipments it agrees to pay each quarter over the benchmark London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price CMAL0 set the benchmark for the region.
The hike reflected higher premiums in other Asian markets such as South Korea while the premiums in the United States and Europe remained at high levels, a source from a Japanese trading house said.
""We had to compromise to agree at $130 this week as a producer was not going to lower its offer any further,"" a source at a Japanese fabricator said.
Both sides share the view that local demand for the light metal remains weak due to slow recovery in automobile production, causing high levels of inventories.
Aluminium stocks at three major Japanese ports AL-STK-JPPRT stood at 370,700 tonnes at the end of March, above 354,300 tonnes a year earlier, according to Marubeni Corp 8002.T.
But lower import during the last quarter will likely trim the inventory in the coming months, another source at a producer said.
Japan's import of aluminium and aluminium alloys in January-March declined by 23% from a year earlier, the trade data shows.
The quarterly pricing talks, which began in late February between Japanese buyers and global suppliers, including Rio Tinto Ltd RIO.AX and South32 Ltd S32.AX, have dragged on for a month longer than usual because of a wide gap in two sides' market outlooks. The last round of talks also lasted long.

WASHINGTON, March 23 (Reuters) - The chief executives of American Airlines AAL.O, United Airlines UAL.O, Delta Air Lines DAL.N and other carriers on Wednesday urged U.S. President Joe Biden to end a federal mask mandate on airplanes and international pre-departure testing requirements.
The airline executives, including the chairman of Southwest Airlines LUV.N and JetBlue's JBLU.O CEO, said in a letter the restrictions ""are no longer aligned with the realities of the current epidemiological environment.""
The Biden administration this month opted to extend current COVID-19 mask requirements at airports, train stations, ride share vehicles and other transit modes through April 18. The order was set to expire on March 18.
""It makes no sense that people are still required to wear masks on airplanes, yet are allowed to congregate in
crowded restaurants, schools and at sporting events without masks, despite none of these venues having the protective air filtration system that aircraft do,"" the airline letter said.
The White House declined to comment, but earlier this month said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was working to help develop ""a revised policy framework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public transportation corridor.""
Delta CEO Ed Bastian in a separate statement said ""considering the improved public health metrics in the U.S. and medical advancements to prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19, the federal mask mandate and pre-departure testing no longer fits with the current environment.""
The letter also made reference to ""thousands of airline employees charged with enforcing"" the COVID rules.
The mask requirements have resulted in significant friction on airplanes. The Federal Aviation Administration says since January 2021, there have been a record 6,942 unruly passenger incidents reported - and 70% involved masking rules
Last week, the U.S. Senate voted 57 to 40 to overturn the 13-month-old public health order requiring masks on airplanes and other forms of public transportation, a move that drew a quick veto threat from Biden.
The mask mandate has drawn significant opposition from Republicans who noted the CDC says 99.5% of Americans live in places where it is safe to ditch indoor masks.
The letter cited the CDC data arguing ""the science clearly supports lifting the mask mandate.""
The 2021 CDC order said the mask mandate could help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in crowded transport settings.

Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) , settled on a loss of 42.5 points, or 0.3%, at 15,233.22, the day wasn't a total loss. In fact, the blue-chip index hit another new all-time high of 15,302.49 in late-morning trading. Just seven Dow components closed in positive territory, powered by Cisco Systems ( CSCO ), which rallied 12.6% after its earnings report.

A Trader's Take :
""The economic data was rather weak, ""summarized Detrick. ""From jobs data, to housing starts, to the Philly Fed's manufacturing data, all disappointed. Considering the recent run higher and the chance traders were given to bail on 'bad' news today, though, the price action was (for the most part) encouraging. Markets held tough until a late-day dip.""

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.

From home building to precious metals, here are seven undervalued mid-cap stocks that investors can buy now.
Owens Corning (OC): The company is weathering inflation and growing its margins and free cash flow.
Kinross Gold (KGC): Addition by subtraction suggests this mining stock is ready to move higher.
Alcoa (AA): Higher aluminum prices in the short-term make this stock a buy-the-dip opportunity.
Genworth Financial (GNW): The aging of America is likely to drive the stock price higher.
Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO): Never underestimate the power of free cash flow, and this company has plenty of it.
Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS): Even if home building slows, the company’s products will remain in demand.
KB Home (KBH): The company’s business model gives it an advantage if demand for housing picks up.

This is a time when many investors are playing defense. But I’d like to suggest you consider another factor: diversification. There’s never a bad time for investors to have a diversified portfolio, but it’s even more important in times when the market is being repriced.
However, real diversification means not just diversity of asset classes, but diversity within asset classes. So while blue-chip, large-cap stocks are always good choices, now may be a time to invest in undervalued mid-cap stocks. These are stocks with a market cap between $2 billion and $10 billion.
Many mid-cap stocks are still in the expansion phase. This means that some of them may become large-cap stocks at some point. However, many fall into the category of cyclical stocks.
That brings me back to defensive plays. Just like any other category, it’s important to look for mid-cap stocks that are in sectors of the market that are likely to benefit from stable, or increasing, consumer demand. Here are seven undervalued mid-cap stocks that meet that criteria.
OC Owens Corning $90.72
KGC Kinross Gold $4.51
AA Alcoa $54.44
GNW Genworth Financial $3.77
ASO Academy Sports and Outdoors $35.51
FBHS Fortune Brands Home & Security $69.17
KBH KB Home $32.65
Owens Corning (OC)
Source: ARMMY PICCA/ShutterStock.com
The first of our undervalued mid-cap stocks is Owens Corning (NYSE:OC). From a purely fundamental perspective, OC stock sports a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9x, which is considerably less than the sector average of more than 15x.
Owens Corning does significant business in the remodeling and new construction markets. And currently, housing starts are showing signs of leveling off. The company also does significant business in the non-residential construction market, which is looking to be slightly weaker this year.
Furthermore, inflation is affecting the company’s input costs. With all that said, Owens Corning still generated operating margins of 18%, which were over 300 basis points higher than in the same quarter in the prior year.
Owens Corning reported earnings in late April and had a double beat on earnings and revenue. More importantly, both numbers were higher on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. Management expected that trend to continue in the second quarter.
A deeper dive into the numbers revealed healthy free cash flow generation of $51 million. The company also returned $264 million of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Kinross Gold (KGC)

The story for Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) has been the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company addressed that situation by selling off its assets in Russia, then divested itself of its Chirano mine in Ghana. The two transactions will bring in just over $900 million.
Of course, investors are right to wonder how this will affect the company’s overall production. After all, one of the concerns about KGC stock is not its valuation (it has a forward P/E ratio of 10.3x), but its growth outlook. Analysts were already forecasting lower production in the years to come.
7 Defensive Dividend Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now
However, I share the opinion of Faisal Humayun, who argues selling these assets will allow Kinross to be more aggressive in generating revenue from its existing core assets. Investors can review its earnings released May 10 to get an idea of what the company believes.
Alcoa (AA)

Next on our list of undervalued mid-cap stocks is Alcoa (NYSE:AA). Like many stocks in this current market sell-off, AA stock is down significantly in the last month. In that time, the company reporting record earnings, but a slight miss on revenue. In an environment such as the one we’re in, that’s all it takes to send a stock lower.
But for opportunistic investors, this may represent a chance to get in on AA stock at a bargain price. Aluminum prices remain at historically high levels, and Alcoa is likely to benefit from the current supply-demand imbalance from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
If that is indeed the case, expect earnings and revenue to move considerably higher. That seems to be the opinion of analysts, who give the stock a mean price target of $91.42, which is a 61% increase from the price as of May 10.
Genworth Financial (GNW)
Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com
Genworth Financial (NYSE:GNW) makes this list of undervalued mid-cap stocks because of its focus on long-term care insurance (LTC). Simply put, America is aging at an accelerating rate, and many people are taking proactive measures to address the potential challenges that come with this.
This is showing up in the company’s performance. In its most recent earnings report, Genworth announced a $350 million share repurchase authorization, the company’s first such program in 13 years. It also reported revenue of $149 million and earnings of 25 cents per share.
Genworth continues to retire its debt which helps a debt-to-equity ratio which is already among the lowest in its sector. Although there are some concerns about future growth, particularly earnings growth, the company is very undervalued with a P/E ratio of just 2.4x.
7 Dividend-Paying Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in May
Investors should be advised that Genworth also has exposure to the mortgage insurance sector. This side of the business may not be as strong as interest rates increase in 2022.
Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO)

Texas-based Academy Sports and Outdoors (NASDAQ:ASO) is becoming one of the nation’s largest sporting goods and outdoor entertainment retailers. This was a sector that thrived during the pandemic as individuals looked to bring the gym experience into their homes.
In 2021, ASO stock and others like it continued to thrive as youth sports reopened. But in November, ASO stock got caught up in the market selloff and is down nearly 30% from its 52-week high.
However, the company reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and revenue and has an impressive free cash flow. All of this supports other fundamental metrics that suggest ASO stock is certainly one of the undervalued mid-cap stocks to consider.
Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS)
Source: Shutterstock
Home buying may be cyclical, but home improvement is an evergreen sector. And with brands like Moen and MasterLock, Fortune Brands Home & Security (NYSE:FBHS) merits a place on this list of undervalued mid-cap stocks.
Analysts give the stock a consensus price target of $100.79, which is about 44% upside from its current level. In the company’s first-quarter earnings report, its revenue came in at $1.9 billion, which was higher than the $1.8 billion the company reported in the same quarter in 2021. However earnings were slightly lower. That’s perhaps the reason analysts are cooling on the FBHS stock price.
7 Restaurant Stocks Ready for a 'Revenge Travel' Rally
The key thing to know is the consensus price target stays high even though several analysts have lowered their price targets. It’s always a good sign when price targets are going down, but remain above the consensus estimate.
KB Home (KBH)

Several of the stocks on this list have been a play on growth in the home building sector, and perhaps none as directly as KB Home (NYSE:KBH). If you’re hesitant to jump on a home building stock, that’s understandable. The bears don’t have to do anything more than point to rising interest rates to suggest the housing market may be rolling over.
However, at the very least, this is one for your watchlist. KBH stock is undervalued by many fundamental metrics.
The company has a build-to-order business model that allows broader customization for home buyers. You could further theorize that buyers of custom homes may be less sensitive to rising mortgage rates.
Additionally, homebuilder stocks may have found a level of support. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is saying the Fed is not considering rate increases of more than 50 basis points at this time.

2525.0,2023-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,"Embraer bags fresh Binter, American Airlines orders for E-Jets",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/embraer-bags-fresh-binter-american-airlines-orders-for-e-jets,,,"By Gabriel Araujo
PARIS, June 20 (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer EMBR3.SA on Tuesday notched fresh orders from American Airlines and Spanish carrier Binter for its E-Jets in deals announced at the Paris Airshow that are seen totaling about $1 billion.
The new firm orders come amid an influx of deals at the world's largest air show, which is at Le Bourget for the first time in four years and took off on Monday with Airbus AIR.PA bagging a record 500-plane transaction.
Embraer, the world's third-largest planemaker after Airbus and Boeing BA.N, said the new orders follow expansion goals of regional carriers such as Binter and Canada's Porter Airlines, underscoring positive momentum for its planes in global markets.
Despite the new deals, shares of Embraer slipped more than 4% in midday trading in Sao Paulo, making it the biggest faller on the benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP, as analysts at JPMorgan said the firm had a ""slow start"" in Paris.
""We were expecting Embraer to announce at least 30 new orders during the event,"" they said. ""We believe that additional new orders could be announced in the coming days, as in the last Paris Air Show Embraer divided its announcements into 3 days.""
Binter has placed a firm order for six E195-E2 aircraft, marking its fourth order of E2 jets to bring its fleet to 16 when delivered. The deal was valued at $504.7 million at list price, with deliveries commencing in the second half of 2024.
The carrier's president Rodolfo Nunez touted the aircraft as ""a game changer"" for the company and ""the perfect aircraft to lead our continued growth"", citing better-than-expected fuel burn and maintenance.
""The best orders are repeat orders,"" Embraer's Chief Commercial Officer for commercial aviation Martyn Holmes said.
That also applies for American Airlines which ordered seven E175 planes for its Envoy Air subsidiary, whose fleet of E-Jets will grow to over 141 aircraft by the end of 2024 after the new $403.4 million deal.
Leasing firm Avolon meanwhile signed a sale and leaseback agreement with Porter, already an Embraer customer, for 10 new E195-E2s in a transaction priced at $841.2 million, according to Embraer.
That is ""another sign that the momentum the E2 is enjoying in the market is set to continue"", Holmes said.
The Brazilian company expects its commercial aircraft unit to deliver from 65 to 70 jets this year, up from 57 in 2022, and had previously said sales were also enjoying strong performance as travel rebounds post-pandemic.
The firm has restored its backlog to pre-2020 levels and is working to achieve 100 commercial deliveries a year within 3-4 years.

Easily the biggest factor behind why stocks are down this week is the Covid-19 Omicrom variant. News of the new coronavirus mutation sent markets into a tizzy are traders feared additional lockdowns and restrictions.
Talk about Omicron initially kicked off last week and saw some of the normal stocks take a hit. That airline and cruise stocks, such as American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), as well as Carnival (NYSE:CCL), Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE:RCL), and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH).
In that same vein, hotel stocks, including Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR), Hyatt (NYSE:H), and Hilton (NYSE:HLT), were also taking a beating earlier this week. The threat of diminishing business due to reduced travel really gave them a pounding. However, not all hope is lost.
President Joe Biden recently announced that there are no plans for any more lockdowns. That news seems to have alleviated investors’ fears as some of these travel stocks started to regain lost ground late in the week.

Inflation also continues to be a hot topic among traders and is likely part of the reason why stocks are down this week. Recently, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said it’s time to stop calling inflation “transitory.” Instead, she believes it could affect the economy for a long time due to the ongoing effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
Traders will want to continue tracking Omicorn and inflation as both seem to be factors that will affect stocks for some time.

1551.0,2012-08-16 00:00:00 UTC,Ball Corp to Streamline Production - Analyst Blog,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ball-corp-to-streamline-production-analyst-blog-2012-08-16,,,"Ball Corporation ( BLL ) recently announced that it will cut down 12-ounce beverage can and end production capacity by stalling production at its two plants. In response to the current market demand, the company intends to step up its beverage can capacity in North America. The company will incur an after-tax charge of approximately $30 million related to employee severance and benefits, facility shut down and other actions, and the majority of which is expected to be recorded in the third quarter of 2012.
The two plants to cease production by the end of 2012 are the metal beverage packaging manufacturing plants in Columbus, Ohio, and Gainesville, Florida, subject to customer requirements. The Columbus plant employs around 110 people and two of its four existing lines manufacture standard 12-ounce cans. The Gainesville plant employs 125 people and produces variety of beverage can ends for standard can sizes.
Ball has been witnessing softness in demand for its standard 12-ounce beverage cans. To offset this loss, the company intends to capitalize on the increasing demand for specialty beverage can packaging.
Ball Corporation's second-quarter 2012 adjusted earnings stood at 89 cents per share, which exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents as well as the year-ago adjusted earnings of 85 cents. Total revenue however decreased 0.6% year over year to $2.296 billion, and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.347 billion.
Over the past few years, Ball Corporation has closed facilities to evenly match supply with market demand and effectively cut down costs. It has also taken steps to improve its return on invested capital through the redeployment of assets within its operations. The current plant closures will not only help Ball Corporation rationalize costs in a competitive market, but will further align supply with ever changing customer demand. In the rigid packaging industry, reducing costs, increasing prices, developing new products and expanding volumes are all possible avenues available for boosting earnings.
Broomfield, Colorado-based Ball Corporation is a manufacturer of metal and plastic packaging, primarily for beverages and foods. It also supplies aerospace and other technologies and services to government and commercial customers. Ball Corporation competes with Alcoa Inc. ( AA ), Rexam plc ( REXMY ) and Silgan Holdings Inc. ( SLGN ). Ball Corp. retains a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold rating). Currently, we have a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock.

Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell nearly 1% on Monday, pointing to a fresh round of declines on Wall Street with investors rattled by warnings that Russia could invade Ukraine at any time.
The United States has said the threat of an invasion is imminent, while keeping diplomatic channels open and reaffirming its pledge to defend ""every inch"" of NATO territory.
Declines were across the board, with cyclical banks and industrials including JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Boeing Co BA.N, Caterpillar Inc CAT.N and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N down between 1.4% and 1.9% in premarket trading.
Megacap growth firms including Meta Platforms Inc FB.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Tesla Inc TSLA.O shed between 1.1% and 2.3%.
The CBOE Market Volatility index .VIX, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, shot up to its highest level in nearly three weeks.
Heightening geopolitical risks also hit global equity markets, with Asian stocks kicking off the day in a soft footing followed by a weak performance by European shares. MKTS/GLOB

1207.0,2014-01-22 00:00:00 UTC,"Stock Market News for January 22, 2014 - Market News",AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-news-for-january-22-2014-market-news-2014-01-22,,,"Earnings results and forecasts from Dow components dragged the blue-chip index lower on Tuesday, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended in the green because of other factors. Material stocks ensured that the S&P 500 could avoid its third-straight decline. The day was devoid of any major economic releases but for IMF raising the global economic growth estimate.
For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's Ahead of Wall Street article
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) dropped 0.3% to 16,414.44. On the other hand, the Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) gained 0.3% to close at 1,843.80. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index also finished in the green and jumped 0.7% to 4,225.76. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) gained 3.5% to settle at 12.87. Composite volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 3.8 billion; about two stocks gained for every one that declined.
Markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Day which meant Tuesday was the first trading session of the week. Benchmarks had a choppy run all through the day with the Dow swinging between meager and solid losses and Nasdaq moving between modest and decent gains. As for S&P 500, it moved between red and green territory.
It was earnings numbers that mostly provided direction to the Dow. However, performance results and forecasts were more of a disappointment. Dow components Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ), The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV ) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ) dropped 1.3%, 1.7% and 1.1%, respectively, after announcing earnings results and forecasts.
Healthcare behemoth Johnson & Johnson reported fourth-quarter 2013 earnings (excluding special items) of $1.24 per share, ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.20 per share. However, the company's 2014 earnings projection of $5.75 - $5.85 per share was below market estimates.
The Travelers Companies too reported earnings beat in its fourth quarter but margins were a worrying factor. The company reported lower underlying underwriting margins in some segments. Verizon tanked after reporting results and announcing that it will acquire Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ: INTC ) pay-television startup.
The S&P 500, however, secured a seat in the green, thanks to gains in the material sector. Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) gained 0.6% and led the gains among the S&P 500 industry groups. The upward move was largely aided by a 6.6% gain in The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE: DOW ) after reports that Daniel Loeb, activist investor and hedge fund manager, has bought stake in the company.
Also, a rating and target price upgrade from JPMorgan helped Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA ) move 6.8% higher. Among other gainers, Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON ), Praxair Inc. (NYSE: PX ) and PPG Industries Inc. (NYSE: PPG ) improved 0.3%, 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.
Separately, for the first time in about two years, the International Monetary Fund upped its global economic growth forecast. It forecasted 3.7% growth in the global economy this year, up by 0.1 percentage point from its October forecast. For 2015, IMF projected a 3.9% jump. IMF's chief economist Olivier Blanchard said: ""The basic reason behind the stronger recovery is that the brakes to the recovery are progressively being loosened"".
This was the first trading session of the week and Dow was the only benchmark to start on a losing note. Incidentally, blue-chip index was the sole gainer last week, which was also its first weekly gain this year. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed the week with losses of 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively, but Dow rose 0.1%.

4212.0,2021-09-13 00:00:00 UTC,3 Airline Stocks That Are Cleared For Takeoff,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-airline-stocks-that-are-cleared-for-takeoff-2021-09-13,,,"InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Airline stocks were on the move Thursday, with market-beating gains across the board.
Though they closed off the highs, the relative strength was still impressive. In addition, from a market capitalization perspective, small-caps saw heavy rotation into them early in the day. This provided a tailwind for the rally attempt for airlines.
The various air carriers have seen their share prices suffer over the past two quarters. I’ve been on the lookout for bottoming patterns and other signs that buyers were finally returning. Thursday was one such potential signal. Time and follow-through are needed to confirm the reversal, but now is as good a time as any to tee up trade ideas and otherwise prepare positions so you can enter when confirmation arrives.
7 of the Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Now
There are many airlines to choose from. However, here are three of my favorite ways to play.
Global Jets ETF (NYSE:JETS)
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL)
American Airlines (NYSE:AAL)
Let’s take a closer look at each chart and map out a smart way to profit.
Airline Stocks to Buy: Global Jets ETF (JETS)
Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade
JETS is always on the top of my list when playing airline stocks for two reasons. First, it’s a diversified vehicle providing a one-stop-shop for betting on the entire industry. Second, it’s low-priced enough to make options strategies like naked puts and covered calls cost-effective. Thursday’s high volume surge carried prices above the 50-day moving average to the upper end of its recent trading range.
In fairness to bears, they did succeed in pushing prices back below the 50-day by the closing bell, so the victory wasn’t as complete as I would have liked. Worse still, as I write this on Friday morning, airlines are losing altitude. The absence of any upside follow-through suggests we should remain cautious until the breakout arrives.
My line in the sand is $23.50. If JETS can rise above it, then we have a green light for deploying bullish plays. I prefer short puts due to the high return on investment potential. For now, I like selling the Oct $21 strike price.
Delta Air Lines (DAL)
Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade
If the idea of playing the entire industry with a diversified product like JETS doesn’t appeal to you, then consider picking a specific stock, like Delta. Its price chart is one of the better-looking ones in the space. For starters, its 20-day moving average has been flat for a month, showing stability and the potential for a bottom. Next, Thursday’s high-volume rally was able to close above the 50-day moving average.
The past two months have essentially built a clean trading range with well-defined support and resistance. On the top side, $42 is the level that needs to be breached for a new uptrend to begin. I suggest using that as your trigger for any bullish plays. Since cash flow trades have been working better than directional ones for most of the year, I’m again going with a short put idea.
Once we take out resistance ($42), sell the Oct $38 naked put.
Airline Stocks to Buy: American Airlines (AAL)
Source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade
American Airlines rounds out today’s top stock trades with an imminent breakout of its own. Its flight path mirrors both JETS and DAL. With Thursday’s jump, AAL stock formed a higher pivot low. Unfortunately, the descending 50-day moving average proved too powerful. Friday’s 4+% sell-off reinforces its dominance.
But here’s the silver lining. We now know the level that needs to be broken before the bottoming attempt is complete: $20.50. If we can’t get above it, then all bets are off. If we can, however, then naked puts become mighty appealing. Currently, I like selling the Oct $18 puts once we get the trigger.

By David French
April 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street's ended lower on Thursday, with the Nasdaq dropping more than 2%, as investors reacted to Federal Reserve officials including Chair Jerome Powell offering further signposting of aggressive interest rate hikes this year.
A half-point interest rate increase will be ""on the table"" when the U.S. central bank meets on May 3-4 to approve the next in what is expected to be a series of rate increases this year, Powell said.
With inflation running roughly three times the Fed's 2% target, ""it is appropriate to be moving a little more quickly,"" Powell added in a discussion of the global economy at the meetings of the International Monetary Fund.
""The market is pricing in, at least, 50 basis points in May and June,"" said George Catrambone, head of trading at DWS Group.
""Powell, and many other Fed speakers, have been saying they want to get to control as quickly as possible, and that is saying to the market that they are going to go aggressively.""
Earlier on Thursday, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said she supports raising the U.S. central bank's target for overnight borrowing costs to 2.5% by the end of this year, but whether or how much further it will need to rise will depend on what happens with inflation and labor markets.
The remarks by Fed officials hijacked initial momentum which the markets received from positive earnings. All three major indexes opened higher, boosted by strong results from heavyweight Tesla TSLA.O and airline operators.
However, gains were eroded through the morning session and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had already reversed course by the time Powell spoke.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 368.03 points, or 1.05%, to 34,792.76, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 65.79 points, or 1.48%, to 4,393.66 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 278.41 points, or 2.07%, to 13,174.65.
Bond yields also breached fresh multi-year peaks. Yields on the two-year U.S. Treasury, the most sensitive to interest changes, hit their highest in three years before coming off slightly. US/
High-growth stocks, including those of Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, fell as investors fretted about how the higher rate environment would impact their future growth potential. Meta Platforms Inc FB.O declined 6.2%, taking its losses in the last two days to 13.5%.
Netflix Inc NFLX.O slumped 3.5%, taking its market capitalization below the $100 billion mark for the first time since January 2018. It was the second day of declines for the streaming giant after its quarterly earnings revealed a first drop in subscriber numbers in a decade, with further falls likely.
The forecast prompted William Ackman to liquidate a $1.1 billion bet on Netflix, with the billionaire investor writing the firm's future was too uncertain to hold onto his position.
The 1.7% fall in the broader technology index .SPLRCT was one of the worst among the sectors, with all 11 major industries ending lower. Energy .SPNY was hit the hardest, despite crude prices gaining. O/R
Alcoa Corp AA.Nwas another to slide after posting results. The aluminum producer tumbled 16.9%, its biggest fall since March 2020, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict impacted its business.
There were some bright spots though. Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, rose 3.2% after its results beat Wall Street expectations as higher prices helped it overcome supply-chain chaos and rising costs.
Airline stocks also maintained their recent momentum. United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O and American Airlines Group Inc AAL.Oclimbed 9.3% and 3.8%, respectively, after they predicted a return to profit in the current quarter due to booming travel demand.
The volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.27 billion shares, compared with the 11.65 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
The S&P 500 posted 78 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 367 new lows.

3545.0,2022-05-12 00:00:00 UTC,Is Airbnb a Buy Now?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-airbnb-a-buy-now,,,"Bear markets can seem unfair: Once the selling starts, fundamentals tend to be ignored, and share prices move lower.
This has been the case for Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB). The stock is down 45% from last year's high and lower by 30% year to date. Nevertheless, its fundamentals are not only rock-solid -- they're downright impressive.
So is now the time to buy this proverbial baby that's being thrown out with the bathwater?

Airbnb just crushed first-quarter earnings
Simply put, Airbnb announced stellar first-quarter results on May 3, beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue of $1.51 billion topped estimates of $1.45 billion, and the first-quarter loss of $0.03 per share was well ahead of the $0.29-per-share consensus.
The company reported over 102 million nights and experiences booked, an all-time high. Airbnb's average daily rate, a vital leisure industry metric, rose to $168, up 5% from a year earlier. The company is expanding on multiple fronts -- not only are overall nights booked rising, but the average rate for those stays is rising too.
What's more, the company provided upbeat guidance. Management indicated second-quarter revenue should fall between $2.03 billion and $2.13 billion. Wall Street analysts have noticed and scrambled to adjust their full-year earnings estimates higher. In fact, full-year 2022 earnings estimates have nearly doubled since three months ago.
TIME OF ESTIMATE FULL-YEAR 2022 FULL-YEAR 2023
Current $1.92 $2.49
7 days ago $1.27 $2.05
30 days ago $1.33 $2.04
60 days ago $1.34 $2.04
90 days ago $0.97 $1.67

Airbnb is now the leading American travel site
One driving force behind Airbnb's outstanding earnings results is that the company continues to take market share from its competitors. As this chart shows, Airbnb is now the leading U.S. travel site with close to 5% of overall traffic.

Moreover, the company's ""I'm Flexible"" feature seems to be a game changer. Airbnb reports it has been used over two billion times since its introduction last year. The feature drives traffic to less popular locations -- helping to match guests and hosts more evenly across the platform and increase conversion (i.e., booking) rates.
Why Airbnb looks like a screaming buy right now
Bear markets can be scary. Some stocks are losing 50% or more of their value literally overnight. But for long-term investors, bear markets are a great time to buy good companies when they're oversold. Airbnb certainly seems to fit that mold.
Despite reporting excellent first-quarter results, shares are at all-time lows. That's a great time to load up on a company with a great business model, solid fundamentals, and a strong management team.

3338.0,2022-08-04 00:00:00 UTC,September 23rd Options Now Available For American Airlines Group (AAL),AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/september-23rd-options-now-available-for-american-airlines-group-aal,,,"Investors in American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL) saw new options begin trading today, for the September 23rd expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the AAL options chain for the new September 23rd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $14.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.04. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $14.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $13.46 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of AAL, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $14.72/share today.
Because the $14.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.17% return on the cash commitment, or 52.36% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.
Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for American Airlines Group Inc, and highlighting in green where the $14.50 strike is located relative to that history:
Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $15.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.05. If an investor was to purchase shares of AAL stock at the current price level of $14.72/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $15.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.04% if the stock gets called away at the September 23rd expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if AAL shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for American Airlines Group Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing AAL's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $15.00 strike highlighted in red:
Considering the fact that the $15.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.13% boost of extra return to the investor, or 52.07% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.
Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $14.72) to be 56%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

1893.0,2010-03-02 00:00:00 UTC,Attention Citigroup Board: Pandit Does Not Deserve a Bonus,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/attention-citigroup-board-pandit-does-not-deserve-bonus-2010-03-02,,,"Amit Chokshi submits:
Bloomberg reported Monday that Citigroup's ( C ) Board of Directors believes CEO Vikram Pandit deserved a bonus for 2009. This is a laughable assertion and significant shareholders should really hold the feet of the Board of Directors of Citigroup to the fire. Is the Board beholden to shareholders or its CEO? Giving Pandit a bonus would further dilute the investment of shareholders (albeit slightly) so given that Pandit did the right thing and declined a bonus, why change course in a move that is detrimental to shareholders?
In typical, ""me too"" mentality, C's Board believes because the CEOs of other banks such as Jamie Dimon or Lloyd Blankfein received bonuses in large part due to market recoveries and their banks' special status in receiving massive taxpayer subsidies, that C's CEO should also get a bonus. Pandit has done the right thing first off by declining any bonus. While he did bilk his predecessor Chuck Prince into paying an idiotic price for a mediocre hedge fund, Pandit has now done right by shareholders by saying he would pass on a bonus, particularly since he deserved no bonus whatsoever.
The author of the Bloomberg article, Bradley Keoun, indicates that Board members felt Pandit deserved a bonus in part due to C's ability to raise capital, sell assets, and repay $20B in TARP. Anyone could have done the same job as Pandit as all of these moves were predicated on market conditions as opposed to any managerial talent.
C was able to raise capital but at what price? C has consistently diluted shareholders and its success in raising capital has largely been due to massive US taxpayer support. The last capital raise C executed was to repay its TARP obligation. Laughably, this capital raise was done at essentially C's low of the entire crisis. Apparently, raising billions of high cost equity capital at multi decade lows is a sign of managerial talent according to C's Board. In addition, C was a follower in this event, raising capital to pay back TARP because its competition had done so, hardly a sign of forward thinking.

CHART I: C STOCK PERFORMANCE
C's Board wants to credit Pandit for selling off C assets. A quick memo to the Board: C had to sell off assets. C sold off much of its garbage and did so in many cases at great prices but this again has nothing to do with managerial acumen. What happened was when C was receiving capital from the US taxpayer during the height of the crisis, managers were scared and felt that all of their loans were worthless so they took heavy marks on these securities. In 2009, credit spreads compressed, in part due to the Federal Reserve and US taxpayers' actions which buoyed the market. All of a sudden securities marked at $0.20 on the dollar were worth $0.40 or $0.80 or more. C, which had to divest itself of its more racier securities, sold these but only because market conditions allowed for it.
I own C shares myself and am very bullish on the company but it's in no part due to the managerial talent of the company. It's due to mostly to deep analysis of the company's financial statements and running analyses that indicate there's value at C. As a shareholder I am more concerned by the Board's preference to treat Pandit at the expense of the true owners of C.
However, when reading that some of the directors that believed Pandit deserved a bonus included Alcoa ( AA ) Chairman Alain Belda, former Time Warner ( TWX ) CEO Richard Parsons, and Xerox ( XRX ) Chairwoman Anne Mulcahy, I was not that surprised. After all, a quick review of the stock performance of the respective companies for each of these management executives in recent years demonstrates that the shareholders received a fair kick in the teeth while these executives no doubt collected tens of millions for destroying shareholder value.
CHART II: ALCOA, XEROX, TIME WARNER STOCK PERFORMANCE
C's Board is clearly polluted with mediocre executives that received major rewards for delivering years of subpar performance to the shareholders of their respective companies. As a result, they have a skewed worldview of what warrants incentive compensation. While I'm not hopeful of any changes to corporate governance, large C shareholders should really contemplate to whom C's Board is beholden.

Oct 20 (Reuters) - Futures tracking the Dow and S&P 500 gained on Thursday as positive forecasts from IBM and AT&T helped offset declines from Tesla after it warned of missing its vehicle delivery target this year.
IBM Corp IBM.N rose 3.3% in premarket trading, leading the advance among Dow components after the software and IT services company beat quarterly earnings estimates on Wednesday and said it expects to exceed full-year revenue growth targets.
Fellow blue-chip stock Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N shares added 0.6% after peer wireless carrier AT&T Inc T.N added 2.5% upon raising its annual profit forecast.
American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O also expects to report a profit in the December quarter above Wall Street estimates, pushing its shares up 2.9%.
The positive forecasts arrive after upbeat results by big U.S. banks, Netflix Inc NFLX.O, Procter & Gamble Co PG.N and Travelers Companies Inc TRV.N, prompted analysts to raise third-quarter profit growth expectations for S&P 500 companies to 3% from 2.8%, according to Refinitiv data.
However, the estimate is still sharply lower than an 11.1% increase forecast at the start of July.
Shares of electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O dropped 5.1% as the company flagged persistent logistics challenges, with fourth-quarter deliveries growing by less than the aimed 50%.
The main U.S. indexes have in the last two months been hammered by fears of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, that have pushed Treasury yields to multi-year highs amid no real signs of U.S. inflation slowing.
The U.S. central bank is expected to deliver its fourth straight 75 basis-point hike in its November meeting, with some even pricing in a full percentage point raise.
Snap Inc SNAP.N rose 1.3% as it is seen kicking off earnings season for tech and social media companies later in the day, with expectations of modest revenue growth across most of the sector as results will be compared with a difficult 2021 when Apple Inc's AAPL.O privacy changes began to upend the advertising industry.
Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Meta Platforms Inc META.O, which make majority of their revenues from digital ad sales, edged higher ahead of results next week.

415.0,2023-10-11 00:00:00 UTC,Analysts Estimate Alcoa (AA) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/analysts-estimate-alcoa-aa-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings%3A-what-to-look-out-for-2,,,"The market expects Alcoa (AA) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 18, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This bauxite, alumina and aluminum products company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -215.2%.
Revenues are expected to be $2.59 billion, down 9% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9.62% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alcoa?
For Alcoa, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.29%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.
So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alcoa will beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alcoa would post a loss of $0.59 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.35, delivering a surprise of +40.68%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
Alcoa doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

2045.0,2023-12-16 00:00:00 UTC,"METALS-Copper slips, but prospect of tight supplies sustains sentiment",AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metals-copper-slips-but-prospect-of-tight-supplies-sustains-sentiment,,,"By Pratima Desai
LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Copper prices came under pressure on Monday due to worry about weak demand in top consumer China, but mine closures and disruptions raising the prospect of tighter supplies helped support confidence.
Benchmark copper CMCU3 on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 0.5% at $8,509 a metric ton by 1050 GMT. Prices of the metal used in the power and construction industries touched four-month highs at $8,640 a ton this month.
China's troubled property market has weighed on industrial metals demand for most of this year, despite government measures to support the sector.
Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke expects energy transition demand for copper to offset the slowdown in China.
""The past few weeks have shown copper supply is quite vulnerable, Cobre Panama in particular,"" he said.
Copper has been climbing over the past two months due to uncertainty about supplies from First Quantum's FM.TO Cobre mine in Panama, accounting for 1% of global mined supply last year.
Also helping sentiment was Anglo American AAL.L cutting its copper production guidance by 20% and 18% for next year and 2025 respectively.
Expectations the Federal Reserve could cut U.S. interest rates in the first quarter of next year are weighing on the dollar which is hovering near 4-1/2-month lows against a basket of major currencies. FRX/
A falling U.S. currency makes dollar-priced metals cheaper for holders of other currencies, which could help demand.
However, the discount over the three-month copper contract CMCU0-3 near 31-year lows suggests the market does not expect imminent shortages on the LME.
Elsewhere, aluminium prices CMAL3 fell after data showed stocks in LME approved warehouses MALSTX-TOTA jumped 59,850 tons to 504,475 tons, the highest since early October.
However, the impact was brief as funds cutting short position pushed aluminium prices back towards the five-week highs of $2,269.50 a ton hit on Friday.
Three-month aluminium was up 0.6% at $2,261.
In other metals, zinc CMZN3 gained 0.6% to $2,547, lead CMPB3 advanced 0.3% to $2,088, tin CMSN3 slipped 0.5% to $25,050 and nickel CMNI3 dropped 1.8% to $16,840.

1480.0,2012-12-09 00:00:00 UTC,Dow Pariahs for 2013,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/dow-pariahs-2013-2012-12-09,,,"There is something to be said for being greedy when others are fearful and investing when there is blood in the streets. Over the course of time, contrarian thinking has, in many instances, paid off handsomely for those with the required audacity and temerity.
The Dogs of the Dow Theory is somewhat contrarian in its approach as it advocates investors embracing the blue chip index's 10 highest-yielding names at the start of the new year. The premise is that dividend payers do not their payouts based on trading environment and that the high yields are a sign of a bottom in these shares.
What about the Pariahs of the Dow? Meaning the index's worst performers. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) was the Dow's worst performer in 2011. This year, the stock has nearly doubled. Keeping in mind that there are no guarantees that the Bank of America scenario will repeat itself every with the Dow's worst laggard, the following stocks are among the Dow's worst performers in 2012.
Please note that according to Finviz data , just six of the Dow 30 are down on the year as of December 7. Those not included in this piece are Alcoa (NYSE: AA ), DuPont (NYSE: DD ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ).
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) Hewlett-Packard is this year's Dow version of Bank of America as the personal computer giant is sitting on a loss of more than 45 percent. Indeed, it would require a heavy contarian outlook to embrace HP, though there is a case for doing so .
However, even the best contarians do not become so just for the sake of betting against the herd. And there is no way an accomplished can become accomplished by overlooking the obvious. In HP's case, there are myriad, obvious hurdles the company must overcome to even come close to restoring its lost glory.
There is ample speculation that 2012 represents the death of the PC. Investors are clamoring for HP to break itself up to unlock some shareholder value. Then there is the looming $8.8 billion Autonomy acquisition write down that arguably means HP should consider cutting its dividend .
All of this is not to say HP shares will not surge next year. It does mean, however, that investors that embrace this stock are the ultimate contrarians.
Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ) The world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment is not sitting on a bad year-to-date loss, but if the fiscal cliff comes to pass, it will be hard to jump on Caterpillar's train if the U.S. is mired in another recession.
Then there is looming concern among U.S. companies that derive significant portions of their revenue from China about the impact of the rift between the two countries over audit documents . Basically, Chinese regulators are refusing to give their U.S. counterparts access to audit records for nine U.S.-listed Chinese firms, according to Reuters.
This could have a potentially adverse impact on U.S.-based companies that do a lot of business in China, of which Caterpillar is one. Wait-and-see might be the best approach with this stock next year.
McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) One of the Dow's 2011 juggernauts has turned into the one of 2012's laggards as shares of the world's largest fast-food chain are off nearly 12 percent. However, the allure with McDonald's is clear, particularly for conservative investors.
For starters, the stock has a beta of just 0.4 against the S&P 500. Second, the company has raised its dividend for 35 consecutive years. Over the past decade, McDonald's has grown free cash flow at a compound annual growth rate of 17.43% . Through the end of 2011, McDonald's free cash flow per share had nearly doubled since 2006.
With a return equity of 40 percent, return on assets of almost 16.5 percent and a dividend yield of nearly 3.5 percent, McDonald's looks like the best-positioned of the three stocks highlighted here to flourish next year.

SYDNEY, April 19 (Reuters) - Asian shares hovered near 1-1/2 week highs on Monday helped by expectations monetary policy will remain accommodative the world over, while COVID-19 vaccine rollouts help ease fears of another dangerous wave of coronavirus infections.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was last at 695.59, within striking distance of Friday's high of 696.48 - a level not seen since Apr. 7.
The index jumped 1.2% last week and is up 5% so far this year, on track for its third straight yearly gain.
""The extremely supportive monetary and fiscal policy setting continues to provide a fertile environment for risk assets,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex strategist at National Australia Bank.
Australian shares .AXJO were 0.25% higher while New Zealand's benchmark index .NZ50 and South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 added 0.4% each. Japan's Nikkei .N225 eased 0.4%.

The European Central Bank (ECB) meets on Thursday with no changes to rates or guidance expected while preliminary data on factory activity around the globe for April is due on Friday.
Elsewhere, Bitcoin BTC=BTSP, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, recouped most of its losses after plunging as much as 14% on Sunday following speculation the U.S. Treasury may be looking at cracking down on money-laundering activity within digital assets, NAB's Catril said.
Data website CoinMarketCap cited a blackout in China’s Xinjiang region, which reportedly powers a lot of bitcoin mining, for the selloff.
The retreat in Bitcoin also comes after Turkey's central bank banned the use of cryptocurrencies for purchases on Friday.
Bitcoin is up more than 90% year to date, driven by its mainstream acceptance as an investment and a means of payment, accompanied by the rush of retail cash into stocks, exchange-traded funds and other risky assets.
In currencies, the U.S. dollar =USD loitered near a four-week low against a basket of currencies as investors increasingly bought into the Federal Reserve's insistence it would keep an accommodative policy stance for a while longer.
The dollar index measuring the greenback against a basket of six currencies was unchanged at 91.612, not far from its lowest since March 18 touched on Friday.

3653.0,2022-04-14 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines (AAL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-aal-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-should-you-buy,,,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when American Airlines (AAL) reports results for the quarter ended March 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.
The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 21, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings call it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This world's largest airline is expected to post quarterly loss of $2.48 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +42.6%.
Revenues are expected to be $8.81 billion, up 119.8% from the year-ago quarter.
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 142.15% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.
Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Airlines?
For American Airlines, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.54%.
On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.
So, this combination indicates that American Airlines will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.
For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Airlines would post a loss of $1.51 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.42, delivering a surprise of +5.96%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.
That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.
American Airlines appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

4141.0,2021-10-08 00:00:00 UTC,Australian carbon offset prices hit record high in polluters' spree,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/australian-carbon-offset-prices-hit-record-high-in-polluters-spree-2021-10-08,,,"By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Australia's carbon offset prices have jumped 75% to a record high this year in a buying spree by major polluters who need offsets after exceeding emissions levels set by the government.
The unexpected surge in demand to meet a February regulatory deadline amid a temporary shortage of credits has driven prices higher. They could spike even further if Australia bows to international pressure to tighten its emissions reduction pledge for 2030 ahead of a UN climate summit which starts on Oct. 31.
Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) prices hit A$29.50 ($21.51) a tonne this week, up from A$16.52 at the start of the year, data from research firm Reputex and Jarden showed.
Australia's conservative government is also facing global pressure to set a net zero emissions target for 2050 ahead of the Glasgow climate summit, which would impact the offset market over a longer term.
""There's unanticipated demand creating a scramble for credits,"" said Reputex's director of research, Bret Harper.
Major miners like Anglo American AAL.L and metal processors like Alcoa's AA.N Portland aluminium smelter, which have been emitting above baselines set under Australia's emissions ""safeguard mechanism"", have had to buy ACCUs to surrender to the government to offset their excesses.
Anglo American's emissions have climbed as it digs deeper underground into coal seams that contain more methane. It captures around 65% of the methane produced at its mine and uses it to generate electricity, and is also pursuing new technology to meet a goal of net zero by 2040, a company spokesperson said.
""Where we have exceeded baselines due to geological or operational issues, and in ensuring the safety of our people, we have proactively purchased ACCUs as offsets, although under multi-year averaging arrangements, we may not require all of them,"" the spokesperson said in emailed comments.
The Clean Energy Regulator, which issues ACCUs, said it expects to issue a record 17 million ACCUs this year, representing 17 million tonnes of carbon emissions, up from 16 million last year.
While there is a shortage now, ACCU supply is set to grow as carbon brokers create more offsets by teaming up with farmers for reforestation, avoided deforestation and soil carbon projects. The government last week also approved carbon capture and storage projects to generate ACCUs.
The National Farmers Federation (NFF), though, says farmers should be careful about tying up land in carbon sequestration projects when carbon offset prices are so low in Australia compared to elsewhere in the world and they have to split proceeds with brokers and developers.
""While we're pro-choice, we don't want the farm sector to give up land for everyone else who's a carbon emitter,"" said Warwick Ragg, the NFF's general manager for natural resource management.
European Union (EU) carbon prices have soared this year to more than 60 euros ($69.39) a tonne, more than triple the offsets in Australia, spurred by the EU's new target to cut carbon emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030.
Harper said demand for Australia's carbon offsets will rise over the long run, whether or not the government sets a net zero target, as major companies with their own carbon neutral targets find there is limited technology to meet them.
""Demand for these credits just keeps going up and up and up as more entities realise what it's going to take to get to net zero. I think demand will do nothing but increase broadly,"" Harper said.

26.0,2023-10-31 00:00:00 UTC,Ametek (AME) Q3 Earnings Surpass Estimates,A,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ametek-ame-q3-earnings-surpass-estimates,,,"Ametek (AME) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.64 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.45 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.80%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of electronic instruments and electromechanical devices would post earnings of $1.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.57, delivering a surprise of 3.29%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.
Ametek, which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Testing Equipment industry, posted revenues of $1.62 billion for the quarter ended September 2023, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.55%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.55 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.
The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.
Ametek shares have added about 0.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.5%.
What's Next for Ametek?
While Ametek has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?
There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.
Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ametek: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.62 on $1.72 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.26 on $6.61 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Testing Equipment is currently in the top 26% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
Another stock from the same industry, Agilent Technologies (A), has yet to report results for the quarter ended October 2023. The results are expected to be released on November 20.
This scientific instrument maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.34 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -12.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.3% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.
Agilent Technologies' revenues are expected to be $1.67 billion, down 9.7% from the year-ago quarter.
5 Stocks Set to Double
Each was handpicked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2023. Previous recommendations have soared +143.0%, +175.9%, +498.3% and +673.0%.
Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.

4462.0,2021-05-19 00:00:00 UTC,JetBlue set for transatlantic debut to London in August,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jetblue-set-for-transatlantic-debut-to-london-in-august-2021-05-19,,,"By Tracy Rucinski
CHICAGO, May 19 (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways JBLU.O said on Wednesday it plans to enter the transatlantic market with low-fare flights from New York to London in August, disrupting what is normally one of the world's busiest international routes.
The airline will launch daily flights to London's Heathrow Airport on Aug. 11 and to Gatwick on Sept. 29, it said in a statement.
While the COVID-19 pandemic has largely stalled travel between the United States and Britain, it opened the door for JetBlue to secure coveted slots at the two London airports, where it hopes to build a larger presence over time and expand the success of its Mint domestic business-class service.
For now, JetBlue has the slots for daily Heathrow service through October but is selling flights through March 26, 2022 because it believes it can secure slots through the winter while it works to obtain longer-term access.
""We expect Heathrow is going to want us to stay once they see what we can do in terms of driving competition,"" JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty told Reuters.
JetBlue is launching the London flights from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) on its new Airbus A321LR jets, a longer-range variant of the A321neo, with roundtrip Core cabin fares starting at $599 for U.S.-based travelers and 329 pounds for those based in the U.K.
Fares for Mint class, which features 24 lie-flat private suites, will start at $1,979 and 999 pounds.
By comparison, a roundtrip flight from JFK to Heathrow on American Airlines AAL.O or partner British Airways between Aug. 11 and Aug. 18 is selling at $2,573 in business class and $5,489 in first class, according to a web search.
JetBlue is among airlines calling for a speedy reopening of U.S.-Britain travel, something Geraghty was ""cautiously optimistic"" would happen before its London flights begin in August.
Once that happens, JetBlue expects demand patterns to mirror those within the United States, where leisure travel is quickly climbing toward pre-pandemic levels as COVID-19 restrictions ease and more Americans get vaccinated.
JetBlue plans to launch a London service from Boston in the summer of 2022 and continues to seek other European destinations, Geraghty said.

The news comes when U.S. carriers are burning $180 million in cash daily as passenger volumes remain down nearly 70% from year earlier levels due to the restrictions triggered by the pandemic.
Shares of Delta Air Lines DAL.N shed about 7%, while those of American Airlines AAL.O and United Airlines UAL.O fell about 6%. Southwest Airlines dropped about 5% in premarket trading.
The new strain, said to be up to 70% more transmissible than the original, has prompted Canada, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands to suspend flights from Britain, while France has also barred freight carriers.
Investors also shrugged off the $15 billion in new payroll assistance for U.S. airlines, expected to be finalised on Monday, as part of a new coronavirus aid.
Shares of other U.S. travel companies too were lower on Monday.

1859.0,2010-07-14 00:00:00 UTC,Reconciling Bad Economic Data and Good Earnings,AA,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/reconciling-bad-economic-data-and-good-earnings-2010-07-14,,,"Daryl Montgomery submits:
So far this earnings season, company reports indicate that business is going gangbusters. U.S. economic reports are painting exactly the opposite picture, however. This may not be as contradictory as it appears on the surface.
As for earnings, Intel ( INTC ) reported record numbers yesterday, after Alcoa ( AA ) upgraded its forecast for global aluminum sales and U.S. railroad company CSX ( CSX ) said shipments were up considerably. This morning, however, U.S. retail sales numbers disappointed again, falling 0.5% in June following a 1.1% drop in May. Mortgages for home purchases fell to a 14-year low. According to the non-farms payroll reports, close to a million people net left the U.S. labor market in May and June because jobs were so scarce that they simply gave up looking. Later today, the Federal Reserve is expected to lower its expectations for second half U.S. economic growth.
One of the important things to note is that both Intel and Alcoa are global companies. While many people assume that the U.S. is Intel's major market, it isn't. East Asia dominates Intel's sales. Strong Intel numbers generally indicate a robust East Asian economy. Growth has indeed been strong there. Intel's biggest growth sector by far was servers, which were up 170%. These are used for the Internet. Intel also cited cloud computing as a driver of sales. It is possible for a new technology to grow while the economy declines. The best example of this is the growth of radio during the Great Depression in the 1930s.
As for Alcoa, its projections may prove to be much too bullish. Industrial metals appear weak across the board and this indicates global manufacturing could turn negative in the next few months. CSX's good numbers were dependent on auto shipments. That market in the U.S. peaked in the third quarter of 2009 because of the Cash for Clunkers program. In the June retail sales report, autos were the weakest component.
Investors should not make judgments for the U.S. economy based on figures for global companies, especially when the U.S. is only a minority of their business. The U.S. economy can be much weaker than Asian economies. Asia was in the driver's seat pulling the world out of the Credit Crisis recession and the U.S. followed. The U.S. may lead once again, though, bringing the world into the next recession.

2732.0,2023-04-11 00:00:00 UTC,PREVIEW-Elasticity of travel demand in focus as U.S. carriers report earnings,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/preview-elasticity-of-travel-demand-in-focus-as-u.s.-carriers-report-earnings,,,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO, April 11 (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines are expected to reiterate the strength of travel demand when earnings season gets underway later this week.
But with rising interest rates, high inflation, mounting job losses and turmoil in the banking industry increasing the odds of an economic recession, the spotlight will be on the elasticity of consumer demand.
Pent-up travel demand as well as constrained airline capacity due to shortages of aircraft, spare parts, and labor have, thus far, allowed the industry to avoid the fallout from a slowdown in the broader economy.
The question remains how long this travel boom will last.
""The fallout from the recent banking turmoil and rising interest rates does in our view skew risk to the downside,"" said Christopher Stathoulopoulos, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group.
Chief executives of major carriers last month rushed to reassure jittery investors after a profit warning from United Airlines UAL.O stoked worries about the industry's pricing power.
The industry has been leaning on soaring consumer demand to mitigate higher labor and fuel costs with higher fares.
Yet, Delta Air Lines DAL.N, which kicks off the earnings season on Thursday, has said its first-quarter earnings would suffer due to a run-up in operating costs after its new contract deal with pilots. The Atlanta-based carrier is expected to report a profit of 30 cents a share.
Chicago-based United, which is due to report its first-quarter result next week, is tipped to post a loss of 66 cents a share due to higher costs from a potential contract deal with pilots.
Analysts at Moody's Investors Service estimate labor expense for U.S. carriers will increase by 19% this year.
Meanwhile, surprise output cuts by OPEC+ oil producers earlier this month are expected to drive up fuel bills for airlines, hurting their profits.
""The price elasticity of demand over economic cycles will be the ultimate arbiter of the industry's ability to cover increasing costs,"" Moody's said.

But with rising interest rates, high inflation, mounting job losses and turmoil in the banking industry increasing the odds of an economic recession, the spotlight will be on the elasticity of consumer demand.

WASHINGTON, March 2 (Reuters) - The head of a group representing major U.S. passenger airlines and a senior union official made the case to lawmakers on Tuesday for a third round of federal government assistance, according to testimony seen by Reuters.
Since March 2020, Congress has awarded passenger and cargo airlines, airports and contractors nearly $90 billion in government assistance and low-cost loans, including two prior rounds of payroll assistance for U.S. passenger airlines totaling $40 billion.
The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package approved by the U.S. House last week includes another $14 billion for passenger airlines to keep workers on payrolls for an additional six months. It awaits action by the U.S. Senate.
""We are still struggling and in dire straits,"" Nick Calio, who heads Airlines for America, a trade group representing American Airlines AAL.O, Delta Air Lines DAL.N, United Airlines UAL.O and others, said in testimony before the House Transportation and Infrastructure's aviation subcommittee. ""We were hoping it would be better by now.""
He warned that without the new round of assistance tens of thousands of aviation workers will ""lose their jobs — or experience reductions to wages and benefits — effective April 1.""
In 2020, U.S. airline passenger traffic fell by 60% to 368 million passengers, the lowest since 1984, and reported pre-tax losses of $46 billion. They continue to burn ""an estimated $150 million of cash every day,"" Calio said.
The current COVID-19 bill also includes $8 billion for airports and concessionaires and $1 billion for airline contractors.
Joseph DePete, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, told lawmakers that ""dismal long-term booking commitments and the near absence of business travel demand is leaving some carriers with too little certainty to reactivate and retrain furloughed or otherwise inactive pilots.""
Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the Transportation committee, said he is ""hoping by September 30 we are not going to need another extension"" of airline payroll assistance.

3494.0,2022-06-10 00:00:00 UTC,JPMorgan sees 'growing probability' of a Spirit-JetBlue deal,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/jpmorgan-sees-growing-probability-of-a-spirit-jetblue-deal,,,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO, June 10 (Reuters) - Spirit Airlines Inc's SAVE.N acquisition by JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O has become a ""growing probability"", according to analysts at JPMorgan.
Florida-based ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit is the subject of a bidding war between JetBlue and Frontier Group Holdings Inc ULCC.O.
Both bidders view Spirit as an opportunity to expand their domestic footprints at a time when the U.S. airline industry is dogged by persistent labor and aircraft shortages. Either of the two deals would create the fifth-largest U.S. airline.
""...a merger outcome between Spirit and JetBlue is a growing probability and may overtake the likelihood of a Frontier deal,"" the JPMorgan analysts said in a note published on Thursday.
The comments came days after Spirit postponed a shareholder vote on its merger with Frontier to June 30 from June 10.
JetBlue has sweetened its offer for Spirit by increasing its reverse break-up fee by $150 million to $350 million, raising the overall value of its proposed deal to $3.4 billion. The New York-based airline has also offered to pay a portion of the fee upfront after Spirit shareholders approve the deal.
Frontier has agreed to pay Spirit a break-up fee of $250 million. However, it declined to raise its bid in response to JetBlue's revised offer.
Shareholder advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has urged Spirit shareholders to vote against the deal with Frontier as it reckons JetBlue's deal offers them better value. But if Frontier opts to match JetBlue's break-up fee, ISS said the shareholders can back its deal.
Spirit has repeatedly rejected JetBlue's offer, saying it has a low likelihood of winning approval from U.S. regulators.
JetBlue's ""Northeast Alliance"" (NEA) partnership with American Airlines AAL.O is a sticking point with Spirit.
The Justice Department has sued JetBlue and American to unwind the partnership. Spirit has asked JetBlue to drop the partnership if it wants a deal, but JetBlue has, thus far, declined.
The JPMorgan analysts said JetBlue would be willing to trade away the NEA partnership for a merger with Spirit.
""Mergers are transformational by design,"" they said.

2305.0,2023-08-29 00:00:00 UTC,American Airlines Faces $4.1 Mln Fine For Stranding Passengers On Grounded Planes,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/american-airlines-faces-%244.1-mln-fine-for-stranding-passengers-on-grounded-planes,,,"(RTTNews) - In a significant penalty, American Airlines is slated to pay a hefty fine of $4.1 million imposed by the federal government for numerous incidents involving extended ground delays, during which passengers were confined to planes without the opportunity to disembark. The U.S. Department of Transportation, announcing this on Monday, asserted that this fine marks the most substantial punitive action against an airline since the enforcement of regulations pertaining to prolonged ground delays nearly a decade ago.
The Department of Transportation disclosed that this investigation covered a time span from 2018 to 2021, during which American Airlines held 43 domestic flights on the tarmac for a minimum of three hours, effectively stranding a total of 5,821 passengers without the option to deplane. While there exist exceptions allowing airlines leeway to deviate from these regulations, such as safety and security concerns, the Department of Transportation affirmed that none of these exceptions were relevant in the instances it identified.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg stated, ""This latest measure underscores our ongoing commitment to safeguarding the rights of air travelers,"" emphasizing a resolute dedication to holding airlines accountable within the parameters of consumer protection laws.
The airline giant, American, is required to remit half of the stipulated fine within the forthcoming 30 days. Moreover, the Department of Transportation acknowledged American's payment of compensation to the inconvenienced passengers, attributing this as grounds for granting the airline a credit of just over $2 million, effectively reducing the financial blow.
American Airlines, in response, expressed its intent to minimize instances of protracted ground delays, noting that the 43 affected flights constituted a mere fraction—less than 1%—of the approximately 7.7 million flights executed by American and American Eagle during the period from 2018 to 2021. The airline further conveyed its commitment to providing substantial compensation to passengers who experienced delays, and underlined its enhanced focus on optimizing operational efficiency to mitigate such occurrences.
Of note, the majority of the identified delays transpired at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, where American Airlines maintains a dominant presence. Additional incidents occurred at airports in San Antonio and Houston, typically arising from diversions when flights intended for Dallas-Fort Worth were rerouted. Weather-related challenges, particularly thunderstorms, were cited as contributing factors, which at times hampered the airline's ability to effectively manage gate assignments for passengers to disembark.
Notably, American Airlines expressed reservations concerning the delays incurred at Reagan Washington National Airport during a winter storm in January 2019. However, the airline ultimately assented to the settlement terms outlined in the consent order, signifying a resolution to this regulatory matter.

4359.0,2021-07-09 00:00:00 UTC,Why I Am Long American Airlines (AAL) and Still Buying,AAL,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-i-am-long-american-airlines-aal-and-still-buying-2021-07-09,,,"T
he last few days have been volatile, but there are some things that are value right now, regardless of any short-term market moves. Large airline stocks would be a good example. They have been hit hard in recent months as the delta variant of Covid has delayed the recovery of international travel, but if there is one thing a 2-year chart for a major stock index makes clear, it is that human and economic resilience can beat even a pandemic, and that we will bounce back.
The long-term case for stocks like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta (DAL) is therefore clear, but there is also a short-term argument for owning them, which I should point out, I do. I am long AAL right now and will probably add to that position over the next couple of weeks before the company’s earnings release on July 22. The reason for that is a combination of anecdotal evidence and simple logic.
Last weekend, I took my first post-covid commercial flight. It was a holiday weekend, so I was not surprised that the flight was full, but I was surprised to be told in a conversation with a flight attendant that that is an increasingly common thing. The numbers suggest it shouldn’t be, as domestic passenger volume, while it has recovered strongly, is still down around 26% from pre-covid levels, with the number of flights down only around 21%. Those data, however, are for a couple of months ago. Things have been moving faster since then, with more people flying on fewer flights, and with airlines combining flights to maximize loads.
As a result, there is reason to believe that not only will earnings for last quarter be better than anticipated, but also that they will show a skew towards the end of the quarter that results in a relatively positive outlook. That should be enough to give stocks like AAL and DAL a boost that provides a higher launch point for the gains that will come when international travel begins to recover.
Of course, it isn’t quite that simple; there are risks and potential pitfalls. The delta variant could prove to be the disease that confounds human ingenuity and science, I suppose, but that hasn’t happened yet in human existence and if it does, what stocks you own will be the least of your worries.
Then there are more practical risks. There is a pilot shortage among airlines right now that will necessitate some expenditure to rectify, and if passenger numbers don’t recover quickly enough, that will create some cash flow problems that may lead to another capital raise. Those risks, however, are well known and pretty much priced in at this point. AAL, for example, has a forward P/E of only around 7, way below average, but they have enough cash on hand to survive about a year and a half of losses at last quarter’s rate. Assuming that negative cash flow declines, which the evidence indicates will happen, that will be more than enough and AAL at around $20 will prove to be incredibly cheap.
Ultimately, though, this is a play on the fact that markets tend to overreact to headlines, just as people do. The delta variant proves that viruses can be unpredictable and hard to defeat, but the fact that humankind has been living with and progressing despite various strains of the flu and other viruses for centuries shows that even if we have to live with this one to some extent, the global economy will continue to expand and airlines will, before too long, be profitable again.

Japanese indices were up more up than 1.5% while Chinese indices all closed in positive territory. Yesterday, while US markets were closed, the ECB and BoE took extraordinary steps to give forward guidance on monetary policy, something neither central bank has done in their history.
The biggest market mover today in what was otherwise a quiet session was the June employment report. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 195,000 vs. an estimated gain of 165,000 though unemployment remained unchanged at 7.6%. However, the 3-decimal unemployment remained nearly unchanged at 7.557% from 7.555% the month prior, which is very close to rounding down to 7.5%. There were a number of positive details to the report including a rising average weekly earnings, a rising participation rate, and an increase in the number of people who voluntarily left their jobs. On the other hand, the number of workers who took part-time employment due to economic reasons rose at an alarming rate. Lastly, the biggest market mover came from the positive revisions of 70,000 payrolls over the prior two months.
The Treasury market was the most volatile following the employment data as it priced in an accelerated pace of increases in the Fed funds rate over the coming years. The 10-year Treasury yield rose 22 basis points to 2.72%, the largest one-day move in interest rates this year. In response, a number of mortgage originators raised the interest rate on their loans by 0.25%.
Equities remained in positive territory despite the massive shock to interest rates. S&P 500 future s (INDEXSP:.INX) were up 16 points to 1625 at the time of the employment report and at one point touched negative territory in the early going. Later in the day, prices stabilized slightly below this level with the number of advancing stocks roughly equal to the number of declining stocks. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other interest rate-sensitive sectors were the clear underperformers while financials and tech led.
Monday's Financial Outlook
Monday will bring May growth in consumer credit data, which is forecast to rise by an adjusted rate of $12.5 billion from the month prior. May will be the first month where consumers have experienced sharply higher interest rates so the outcome will be important in determining whether or not it has affected loan growth.
Globally, Germany and Switzerland will release industrial production and the Sentix eurozone investor confidence survey will be released. Additionally, Canada will release housing starts and building permits from June.
Alcoa ( AA ) will report after the close and kick off 2Q earnings. The other notable report for Monday is WD-40 Company ( WDFC ).

Meanwhile, Chevron forecasted a ""substantially lower"" third-quarter profit, which further intensified the bearish mood. Separately, the U.S. Federal Reserve released its ""Beige Book"", which noted that the U.S. economy is advancing modestly with moderate improvement in housing and auto sales in September.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) lost 1.0% to close the day at 13,344.97. The Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) slipped 0.6% to finish yesterday's trading session at 1,432.56. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.4% to end at 3,051.78. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined 0.5% to settle at 16.29. Consolidated volumes on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were roughly 5.9 billion shares, significantly lower than this year's daily average of 6.53 billion shares. Declining stocks outpaced the advancers on the NYSE; as for 60% stocks that dropped, 37% stocks moved higher.
The third-quarter earning season began with disappointing news from Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA ). Alcoa, U.S.'s largest aluminum producing company lost 4.6% after reporting a third-quarter loss. A slowdown in China and low demand for aluminum affected the results. Thus, the company reflected the flagging economic conditions, and that was definitely a disappointment for the markets.
Also, Chevron Corporation's (NYSE: CVX ) shares tumbled 4.2% to $112.45 after it announced that its third-quarter profit is estimated to be ""significantly lower"" on a sequential basis. Chevron's downward revision also brings to mind the trend of other bellwethers taking the same route. Earlier, heavyweights such as FedEx Corporation (NYSE: FDX ), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT ) and Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ ) had issued warnings about upcoming earnings, indicating weak demand in Europe and China. In fact, not many analysts have a bullish view for the third quarter earnings season. According to market experts, the earnings season might not be encouraging enough to push the benchmarks upward and S&P 500 companies may fall 2.3% from last year; their first decline in three years.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve released its Beige Book yesterday, which noted modest improvements in auto and home sales. Consumer spending has increased marginally since the last report. According to the report U.S. economy is growing at a modest rate. This helped the benchmarks trim their initial losses to some extent.
The International Monetary Fund held its meeting in Tokyo and said immediate action should be taken to fix the European debt crisis. The IMF also said that the European Central bank may have to sell $4.5 trillion of their assets if policy makers fall short of pledges. The IMF has slashed global growth rates twice since April 2012, which is a matter of deep concern. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said Greece should be given more time to meet its budget targets. ""It is sometimes better, given the circumstances…to have a bit more time,"" she added.
Separately, the U.S. Census Bureau announced that wholesale inventories data was in line with the consensus estimates. According to the report: ""Total inventories of merchant wholesalers, except manufacturers' sales branches and offices, after adjustment for seasonal variations but not for price changes, were $487.5 billion at the end of August, up 0.5 percent (+/-0.4%) from the revised July level and were up 5.3 percent (+/-1.1%) from the August 2011 level"".
Coming to the sectors, financial bellwether stocks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C ), Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC ), Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS ) and PNC Financial Services (NYSE: PNC ) gained 0.9%, 1.6%, 0.4%, 0.4% and 0.2% respectively.
The energy sector had a bad run yesterday and was a major loser. The Energy Select Sector SPDR lost 1.8%. Stocks such as Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX ), Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM ), TOTAL S.A. (NYSE: TOT ), Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO ) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP ) lost 4.2%, 1.2%, 0.6%, 0.1% and 1.0% respectively.
